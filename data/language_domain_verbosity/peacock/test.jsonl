The Nunamiut traded with the coastal people for other items they needed. A decline in caribou populations in about 1900 and in the 1920s caused many Nunamiut to move to the coastal villages. In 1938, several families of Nunamiut moved back to the Brooks Range, around Tulugak and the Killik River. In 1949 the Tulugak group moved to Anaktuvuk Pass and later the Killik River group moved there also. Anaktuvuk Pass is the only Nunamiut settlement.

The Colorado River narrows to slightly under 1,000 feet wide in one area. Military expeditions that crossed the Colorado River at the Yuma Crossing include Juan Bautista de Anza (1774), the Mormon Battalion (1848) and the California Column (1862). During and after the California Gold Rush to the late 1870s, the Yuma Crossing was known for its ferry crossings for the Southern Emigrant Trail. This was considered the gateway to California, as it was one of the few natural spots where travelers could cross the otherwise very wide Colorado River. Following the United States establishing Fort Yuma, two towns developed one mile down river. The one on the California side was called Jaeger City, named after the owner of Jaeger's Ferry, which crossed the river there. It was for a time the larger of the two, with the Butterfield Overland Mail office and station, two blacksmiths, a hotel, two stores, and other dwellings. The other was called Colorado City. Developed on the south side of the river in what is now Arizona by speculator Charles Poston, it was the site of the custom house.

It predates Jackson by more than a century; the latter replaced Natchez as the capital in 1822, as it was more centrally located in the developing state. The strategic location of Natchez, on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River, ensured that it would be a pivotal center of trade, commerce, and the interchange of ethnic Native American, European, and African cultures in the region; it held this position for two centuries after its founding. In U. S. history, Natchez is recognized particularly for its role in the development of the Old Southwest during the first half of the nineteenth century. It was the southern terminus of the historic Natchez Trace, with the northern terminus being Nashville, Tennessee. After unloading their cargoes in Natchez or New Orleans, many pilots and crew of flatboats and keelboats traveled by the Trace overland to their homes in the Ohio River Valley.

This led to the rise of C\u1ea3ng Th\u1ecb N\u1ea1i, one of the major ports of Champa. The river leading up into the highlands to the west was important for the trade with highland peoples supplying Champa with luxury goods such as eaglewood for export. Vijaya's geography was also important for its agriculture. With one of the larger rivers of Champa, its soils were more fertile than that of many other places. This allowed for a relatively large concentration of people near the centre of Vijaya, which resulted in a relatively large number of temples. The area around Vijaya was probably one of earliest landfalls of the Cham people in what is now Vietnam. However, its architecture implies that it did not become important until the 11th or 12th century. Records suggest that there was an attack on Vijaya's citadel from Vietnam in 1069 (when Vietnam was ruled by L\u00fd Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng) to punish Champa for armed raiding in Vietnam.

This fort was probably destroyed during a battle against the Scythian around 500 BC. Members of the Germanic Silingi tribe who did not participate in the Migration Period but stayed in Silesia chose the place in the 4th century as their fortified center of a Germanic settlement area between \"mons Silencii\" (\u015al\u0119\u017ca) and the river \"Selenca\" (\u015al\u0119za). Slavs arrived after the 6th century and called this place \"Nemci\" ( = mute, metaphorically \"those who do not speak our language\"). Thietmar of Merseburg later described \"Nemzi\" as \"eo quod a nostris olim sitcondita, dicta\" (Nemzi is called like that because it is, according to reports, founded by our people). The settlement was expanded and evolved into the center of the \u015al\u0119\u017canie district. In early times Niemcza became an important base in Bohemias fight for Silesia. After 990 it was seized by Poland and withstood both emperor Henry II. in 1017 and a major offensive of Bohemia in 1093. After 1155 it became the center of a Piast castellany district."}

Sources differ as to why the name What Cheer was chosen. The phrase what cheer with you is an ancient English greeting dating back at least to the 15th century. One theory of the name is that a Scottish miner exclaimed What cheer! on discovering a coal seam near town. A more elaborate theory suggests that Joseph Andrews chose the name because of one of the founding myths of his native town of Providence, Rhode Island. According to the story, when Roger Williams arrived at the site that would become Providence in 1636, he was greeted by Narragansett Native Americans with \"What Cheer, Netop\". Netop was the Narragansett word for friend, and the Narragansetts had picked up the what cheer greeting from English settlers. It is possible that the connection between What Cheer, Iowa and What Cheer, the shibboleth of Rhode Island, was merely coincidental - the entries for these subjects are adjacent but not connected in the 1908 edition of the Encyclopedia Americana. It has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names. Robert Forsyth, born in Kilmarnock, Scotland, came to America in 1857, and made his way to Rock Island, Illinois, where he arrived penniless.

However, for reasons unknown, municipal authorities chose to celebrate the city's 1100th anniversary in 1999. The settlement is indeed an old one, as archeologists unearthed a Paleolithic dwelling as well as Scythian remains within the city limits. The present name of the city is traditionally connected to the settlement Ltava which is mentioned in the Hypatian Chronicle in 1174. According to the chronicle, on Saint Peter's Day (12 July) of 1182, Igor Sviatoslavich, chasing hordes of the Cuman khans Konchak and Kobiak, crossed the Vorskla River near Ltava and moved towards Pereyaslav (presumably the modern Pereiaslav-Khmelnytskyi), where Igor's army was victorious over the Cumans. During the Mongol invasion of Rus' in 1238\u201339 many cities of the middle Dnieper region were destroyed, possibly including Ltava. In the mid 14th century the region was part of the Duchy of Kiev, which was a vassal of the Algirdas' Grand Duchy of Lithuania. According to the Russian historian Aleksandr Shennikov, the region around modern Poltava was a Cuman Duchy belonging to Mansur, who was a son of Mamai. Shennikov also claims that the Mansur Duchy joined the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as an associated state rather than a vassal state, and that the city of Poltava already existed at that time. In 1399 the army of Mansur assisted the army of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the battle of the Vorskla River, while a legend says that after the battle, the Cossack Mamay helped Vytautas to escape his death. The city is mentioned for the first time under the name of Poltava no later than 1430. Supposedly, in 1430 the Lithuanian duke Vytautas gave the city, along with Glinsk (today a village near the city of Romny) and Glinitsa, to Murza Olexa (Loxada Mansurxanovich), who moved to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from the Golden Horde. In 1430 Murza Olexa was baptized as Alexander Glinsky, who was a progenitor of the Glinsky family. According to Shenninkov, Alexander Glinsky must have been baptized in 1390 by Cyprian, Metropolitan of Kiev, who had just regained his title of Metropolitan of Kiev and all Russia (rather than the Metropolitan of Russia Minor and Lithuania) and on 6 March 1390 permanently moved to Muscovy."}

Douglas founded Fort Victoria, on the site of present-day Victoria, British Columbia in anticipation of the outcome of the Oregon Treaty in 1846, extending the British North America/United States border along the 49th parallel from the Rockies to the Strait of Georgia. Erected in 1843 as a Hudson's Bay Company trading post on a site originally called Camosun (the native word was \"camosack\", meaning \"rush of water\") known briefly as \"Fort Albert\", the settlement was renamed Fort Victoria in November 1843, in honour of Queen Victoria. The Songhees established a village across the harbour from the fort. The Songhees' village was later moved north of Esquimalt.

Reference to his map shows that he must have landed and stayed in the Siesia area, the eastern part of modern Nuku\u02bb alofa. Cook also drafted the first map of the bay of Nuku'alofa. The first written record for Nuku'alofa is stated in the first dedicated book for Tonga by George Vason which was published in 1810. George Vason was an English missionary from the London Missionary Society, who arrived in Tonga in 1797. George Vason wrote of their arrival that: The second oldest book dedicated to Tonga was by William Mariner, adopted son of Finau 'Ulukalala, which was published in 1817. Mariner described his experiences during the years he was the adopted son of 'Ulukalala (1806\u20131810). He described the civil war and the siege of the Fort of Nuku'alofa, which fell to 'Ulukalala and his warriors. The third attempt of Christian missionaries were recorded in April 1826, when two Tahitian London Missionaries were detained by Tupou the chief of Nuku'alofa. The arrival of the Methodist missionaries in Nuku'alofa in 1827 reinforced the Christian faith."}

Later the town was one of the 'Five Boroughs' (fortified towns) of the Danelaw, until it was captured by Lady Aethelflaed of Mercia in July 917, subsequent to which the town was annexed into the Kingdom of Mercia. The Viking name Dj\u00fara-b\u00fd, recorded in Old English as Deoraby, means \"Village of the Deer\". This popular belief is asserted by Tim Lambert who states, \"The name Derby is derived from the Danish words deor by meaning deer settlement. \" However the origin of the name \"Derby\" would seem to be elusive: some say it is a corruption of the original Roman name 'Derventio': pronunciation of the letter 'v' as 'b', hence Derbentio, hence Derby, whilst others claim the name could be linked with the river Derwent which flows through the city, in that Derby could be a shortened version of Derwent by, meaning \"Derwent settlement\". Another possible origin comes from Celtic because \"Derwent\" means \"a valley thick with oaks\". The town name appears, nevertheless, as 'Darby' or 'Darbye' in early maps, such as that of Speed (1610). Modern research (2004) into the history and archaeology of Derby has provided evidence that the Vikings and Anglo-Saxons probably co-existed, occupying two areas of land surrounded by water. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (c. 900) says that \"Derby is divided by water\". These areas of land were known as Nor\u00fewor\u00feig (\"Northworthy\", = \"north enclosure\") and Deoraby, and were at the \"Irongate\" (north) side of Derby. During the Civil War of 1642\u20131646, Derby was garrisoned by Parliamentary troops commanded by Sir John Gell, 1st Baronet, who was appointed Governor of Derby in 1643. These troops took part in the defence of nearby Nottingham, the Siege of Lichfield, the Battle of Hopton Heath and many other engagements in Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire and Cheshire, as well as successfully defending Derbyshire against Royalist armies.

Farming, which began in the mid-19th century, was concentrated in the Menifee area. Mining began in the early 1880s with the discovery of a significant quartz lode by miner Luther Menifee Wilson, from which Menifee derived its name. Early development of the Menifee area began with Sun City in the early 1960s, conceptualized as an active retirement community by Del Webb, a building contractor from Phoenix, Arizona. Webb also developed Sun City, Arizona under the same concept. Sun City is a centrally located neighborhood within Menifee with a mix of residential and commercial activity. The Menifee area later grew during the late 1980s and into the early 1990s as a master-planned community. However, lack of resources such as industry-oriented occupations and high-density retail and commercial businesses caused many residents to drive longer distances to nearby cities such as Temecula or Murrieta, to shop, dine, or work. In recent years however, there has been substantial growth in Menifee with new home construction in close proximity to large parks, lakes, and fine amenities, attracting many new residents from all areas of Southern California such as the Inland Empire, San Diego, Orange County and Los Angeles.

Henderson County also shares this namesake. Henderson has its roots in a small, block-wide strip of land high above the Ohio River, the site of the present Audubon Mill Park directly south of the city's riverfront boat dock. A village on this site was called \"Red Banks\" by the local Cherokee on account of its reddish clay soil. By the early 1790s, Red Banks had a tavern and several European-American families along with the Cherokee. On November 16, 1792, resident Robert Simpson wrote to Alexander D. Orr in Lexington, requesting help to appoint a magistrate for Red Banks to deal with some of its 30 families he felt were of dubious (criminal) character. During this period, the Red Banks settlement had gained notoriety as a frontier haven for westward-moving outlaws and their families. One such family was that of Squire Samuel Mason. By that time, excluding the Cherokee, the free male inhabitants of Red Bank totaled 62. On March 17, 1775, North Carolina judge Richard Henderson and his Transylvania Company had met with 1,200 Cherokee in a council at Sycamore Shoals (present-day Elizabethton, Tennessee) to purchase over of land between the Ohio, Cumberland, and Kentucky rivers in present-day Kentucky and Tennessee to resell it to white settlers. Known as the Transylvania Purchase, the sale was voided by the Virginia General Assembly, since the territory (and the sole right to purchase land from Indians within its bounds) was part of Virginia's royal charter. However, the commonwealth granted Henderson and his company an area of to develop. It was located at the confluence of the Green and Ohio rivers."}

Abu Dhabi means father of the \"Dhabi\" (gazelle). It is thought that this name came about because of the abundance of Gazelles in the area and a folk tale involving Shakhbut bin Dhiyab al Nahyan. Abu Dhabi is full of archaeological evidence that points to civilisations, such as the Umm an-Nar Culture, having been located there from the third millennium BCE. Settlements were also found farther outside the modern city of Abu Dhabi but closer to the modern city of Al Ain. There is evidence of civilisations around the mountain of Hafeet (Jebel Hafeet). This location is very strategic because it is the UAE\u2019s second tallest mountain, so it would have great visibility. It also contains a lot of moisture in its springs and lakes, which means that there would have been more moisture thousands of years ago. - Origin of the name Abu Dhabi The origin of the name \"Abu Dhabi\" is uncertain. Meaning \"Father of the Gazelle\", when literally translated from Arabic, it probably referred to the few gazelles that inhabit the emirate. According to Bilal al-Budoor, assistant under-secretary for Cultural Affairs at the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Community Development, \"The area had a lot of dhibaa [deer (plural)], and was nicknamed after that. \" An old story tells about a man who used to chase deer [dhabi (deer \u2013 singular)] and was named the \"father\" of the animal.

Before Kiana became a village, the Inupiat Eskimos tended to travel with certain animal herds; constantly hunting for meat and furs. In the 1800s, the Inupiaqs of Kiana used to live along the Kobuk River. Throughout the year the villagers would hunt and fish near their houses. They moved to where there was an abundance of animals and fish. The Inupiaqs lived in sod houses, and did not live in them twice, because they would move to where the animals were. When someone died inside the house they abandoned it, believing they would catch a contagious disease. Instead of building coffins or digging graves, the villagers wrapped the bodies of the deceased in cloths and put poles in them to make a teepee shape. Archaeological study has been done on the local site 'Igliqtiqsiugvigruaq' (Swift Water Place) which was inhabited by the ancestors of the present day residents of Kiana from 1790 to 1810. The town consisted of burrowed homes connected by tunnels. The first white men came up with boats in 1898 and changed the way of life. They settled in where is now Kiana. More white men came in 1901 and 1902, and started building houses. Inupiaq women moved to them and married them."}

In March 1912 the French government and the Sultan of Morocco, Abd al-Hafid, signed the Treaty of Fez. Because of his growing unpopularity, the Sultan asked the French government for protection against the Berber rebel tribes surrounding Fez. France appointed Hubert Lyautey resident-general in Morocco. General Lyautey restored peace and order to the country after crushing the tribal uprising. After safely moving the Sultan from Fez to the current capital city, Rabat, Lyautey began his task of civilian administration. One of the first preoccupations of General Lyautey was to build ports along the inhabitable Atlantic coast where there were no natural harbors. He established Kenitra in 1912 as a French military fort and town. The port at Kenitra, at the mouth of the Sebou river, was opened in 1913. It soon became the best river port in Morocco.

This possibly reflected that land ownership was concentrated in the hands of a small number of nobles, and therefore there was difficulty in equipping an effective force of hoplites. Thespiae therefore decided to become a close ally of Thebes. The Thespians destroyed Ascra at some point between 700 and 650, and later settled Eutresis between 600 and 550. Thespiae also took control over Creusis, Siphae, Thisbe and Chorisae, probably some time in the late sixth century. The Thessalians invaded Boeotia as far as Thespiae, more than 200 years before Leuctra (according to Plutarch), c. 571 BC, which might have given Thespiae the impetus to join the Boeotian League. But elsewhere Plutarch gives a date for the Thessalian invasion as shortly preceding the Second Persian War. Herodotus suggests that Thespiae had been a member of the league as long as Thebes had been. Following the Persian Wars, Thespiae provided two Boeotarchs to the league, rather than one; perhaps one for the city and one for the districts under its control. During the Persian invasion of 480 BC Thespiae's ability to field a substantial force of hoplites had changed."}

In 1975, the historic core Ko\u017ale on the left bank of the Oder was merged with the municipalities of K\u0119dzierzyn, S\u0142awi\u0119cice (Slawentzitz), and K\u0142odnica (Koldnitz) on the right shore, which had developed to suburbs since the 19th century industrialisation, to form present-day K\u0119dzierzyn-Ko\u017ale. A border fortress held by the Polish Piast dynasty was first mentioned in 1104, when it was besieged by the P\u0159emyslid prince Svatopluk of Olomouc. The Ko\u017ale castellany was part of the Polish Duchy of Silesia since 1138, from 1172/73 of the Upper Silesian Duchy of Racib\u00f3rz under the rule of the Silesian Piasts. In 1281, it was inherited by Duke Casimir of Bytom, who also called himself Duke of Ko\u017ale. Casimir soon turned to the neighbouring Kingdom of Bohemia; in 1289, he paid homage to King Wenceslaus II and received his duchy as a Bohemian fief. In 1293, he vested Ko\u017ale with town privileges, had walls erected. After Casimir was succeeded by his son W\u0142adys\u0142aw in 1312, Ko\u017ale remained the capital of an autonomous duchy, ruled by the Bytom branch of the Silesian Piasts until the death of Duke Boles\u0142aw in 1355. King Charles IV adjudicated the reverted Bohemian fief to the Piast duke Konrad I of Ole\u015bnica (Oels), whereafter the town remained a possession of the Ole\u015bnica line until it became extinct in 1492. Again purchased by the Opole duke Jan II the Good in 1509, the Ko\u017ale estates were ultimatively incorporated into the Lands of the Bohemian Crown upon his death in 1532. Within the Habsburg Monarchy, it was temporarily pawned to the Hohenzollern margraves of Brandenburg-Ansbach. The fortress was besieged several times during the Thirty Years' War and occupied by Danish troops under the command of Duke John Ernest I of Saxe-Weimar in 1627, before they were defeated by Imperial forces under Albrecht von Wallenstein."}

Between the seventh and 10th centuries, the Cham (people of Champa) controlled the strategic spice trade and with this came tremendous wealth. The former harbour town of the Cham at the estuary of the Thu B\u1ed3n River was an important Vietnamese trading centre in the 16th and 17th centuries, where Chinese from various provinces as well as Portuguese, Japanese, Dutch and Indians settled. During this period of the China trade, the town was called Hai Pho (Seaside Town) in Vietnamese. Originally, Hai Pho was a divided town with the Japanese settlement across the \"Japanese Bridge\" (16th-17th century). The bridge (Ch\u00f9a c\u1ea7u) is a unique covered structure built by the Japanese, the only known covered bridge with a Buddhist temple attached to one side.

When European immigrants arrived they found openings in the forest made by the Native Americans, which were used to raise food. Norton Township was originally organized in 1845 by settlers of the village of Mill Point (now Spring Lake). The township was named in honor of Col. Amos Norton, a Canadian patriot who was implicated in the rebellion of 1837. Norton Township was part of Ottawa County and also included the Townships of Fruitport and Sullivan. In 1855 Spring Lake Township was detached from Norton and organized as a township in Ottawa County. Also in 1855 the village of Black Lake was settled with a railroad station and a sawmill in Norton Township.

Marked by a lone Cedar tree, pioneer travelers used it as a rest stop as they traveled from Fairmont to Jackson. Soon there were pioneer settlers and a post office. As stage coaches from Fairmont to Jackson and St. James to Estherville crossed the area, it was concluded that there was a definite need for a settlement. The mid to late 1870s witnessed the arrival of many settlers to Martin County, primarily resulting from the growth of the railroad involving Winnebago City and Fairmont. A company called Cargill, Bassett, and Hunting from La Crosse, Wisconsin, anticipated the railroad expanding west of Fairmont and, consequently, bought land in the area. As steam locomotives took water often, stops were located every fifteen miles or so, which may have contributed the location of the Sherburn railroad station.

The first settlement was probably located around today's Hersdorfplatz outside the north-eastern edge of the later city centre. During the 11th century, the nearby Ludowingians received the village and established the city in the late 12th century, as Gotha became their second most important city after Eisenach. The city generated wealth because it was conveniently located at the junction of two important long-distance trade routes: the Via Regia from Mainz and Frankfurt to Leipzig and Breslau and a north-south route from M\u00fchlhausen over the Thuringian Forest to Franconia. One of the oldest pieces of evidence of busy trade in the city is the \"Gotha cache of coins\" with nearly 800 Bracteates, buried in 1185 in the central city. In 1180, Gotha was first mentioned as a city, when the area between Br\u00fchl and J\u00fcdenstra\u00dfe became the core of urban development, highlighting the early presence of Jews in this old trading town. The parish church of this first urban settlement was St. Mary's Church (demolished in 1530) at Schlossberg. The castle (at the site occupied today by Friedenstein Castle) was first mentioned in 1217. As the Ludowingians died out in 1247, Gotha became part of the Wettins' territories, where it remained until 1918. The new town east of Querstra\u00dfe was established in the early 15th century (with the Neumarkt, first mentioned in 1428). The monastery (first Cistercians, since 1258 Augustinians) was founded before 1251 and abandoned in 1525. Until 1665, the bourse of Gotha was located in the centre of Hauptmarkt square inside the Renaissance building, which hosts the town hall today. The medieval town hall was located on the north-eastern edge of Hauptmarkt, at the site of today's Innungshalle."}

Swinem\u00fcnde became part of the German Empire after the Kingdom of Prussia completed the unification of Germany in 1871. The town had broad unpaved streets and one-story houses built in the Dutch style, which gave it an almost rustic appearance, although its industries, beyond some fishing, were entirely connected with its shipping. The river mouth, which was the entrance to the harbor, and which was regarded as the best on the Prussian Baltic coast, was then protected by two curving long breakwaters, and was strongly fortified.

It was called Dixie by Brigham Young, who was president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. While early settlers cultivated cotton as a commodity crop, they did not succeed in producing it at competitive market rates; consequently, cotton farming was eventually abandoned. More important to the economy was tourism, which developed as the railroads began to carry visitors to the nearby Zion National Park. At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, Brigham Young organized the settlement of what is now Washington County. Fearing that the war would take away the cotton supply, he began plans for raising enough in this southwestern country to supply the needs of his people. Enough favorable reports had come to him from this warm region below the rim of the Great Basin, that he was convinced cotton could be raised successfully here.

Joseph Smith III, son of slain LDS movement founder Joseph Smith, Jr. , moved to Plano in 1866 and ran the church's printing operation from there. As the schism with the Utah branch of the Latter Day Saints deepened, he moved with the church headquarters to Lamoni, Iowa in 1880 to be closer to what the Community of Christ believed to be the true church headquarters at Temple Lot in Missouri rather than in Utah. Community development has been centered around a strong agricultural setting, with the only inhabitants of the area before its incorporation being the owners of grist mills.

It had three sea ports including Pyrgi and Punicum. It was bounded by the two rivers Mola and Manganello, and lay 80 metres above sea level on an outcrop of rocky tuff. The earliest evidence of settlement of the site come from finds of urns at two areas (Cava della Pozzolana and Sorbo) from the 8th and 9th centuries BC and archaeology has revealed the presence of stable employment in the area with housing and related Etruscan necropolis settlements. Trade between the Greeks and Etruscans became increasingly common in the middle of the 8th century BC, with standardised urns and pottery common in graves of the time. The town became the main Etruscan trading centre during the 7th century BC, and trade increased with other Greek colonies in Southern Italy and Sicily, and with the Corinthians. Locally manufactured products began to imitate imported Greek pottery especially after the immigration of Greek artists into Etruria. The oldest examples of Bucchero ceramics come from Caere and it can be assumed that these typical Etruscan ceramics were developed here or produced at least for the first time in large scale. In the Orientalizing Period from around 700 BC the early prosperity of the city is demonstrated in the graves of this period which often contain eastern imports and rich gold finds, notably in the extremely rich Regolini-Galassi tomb with its many fine gold offerings. From 530-500 BC Greek artists were active in the city and worked there for a generation producing color-painted hydras. Burials of the time became increasingly grand, with jewellery and other products of particularly fine manufacture, illustrating the continuing good fortunes of the city. At the height of its prosperity in the 6th century BC, the people of Caere (with the Carthaginians) emerged marginally victorious from clashes with the Phocaean Greeks. Caere had a good reputation among the Greeks for its values and sense of justice, since it abstained from piracy.

However, Mason insisted that the village being platted be named \"Mountain Lake\".

The post office was established July 14, 1906 with Gerhard A. Stenehjem as postmaster. The town was incorporated in 1913 when the Great Northern Rail Road extended its line past Watford City to Arnegard. In 1914, the town built the Arnegard School, a one-story, four room school which taught grades 1 through 12. It opened on January 29, 1915. AS second story and rear annex was built in June 1936. Included were four more classrooms and a library on the second floor, and a gym and principal's office in the rear. The annex was torn down in 1954, and a much larger gym built. By then, the Arnegard Spuds basketball team was winning games throughout the state, and wrestlers too were winning awards. In 1961, the school won the State Class C Boys' Basketball Championship.

Patients often have difficulty walking or maintaining balance, or difference in temperature of an object based on which side of the body the object of varying temperature is touching. Some patients may walk with a slant or suffer form skew deviation and illusions of room tilt. The nystagmus is commonly associated with vertigo spells. These vertigo spells can result in falling, caused from the involvement of the region of Deiters\u2019 nucleus. Common symptoms with lateral medullary syndrome may include difficulty swallowing, or dysphagia. This can be caused by the involvement of the nucleus ambiguous, as it supplies the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves. Slurred speech (dysarthria), and disordered vocal quality (dysphonia) are also common. The damage to the cerebellum or the inferior cerebellar peduncle can cause ataxia. Damage to the hypothalamospinal fibers disrupts sympathetic nervous system relay and gives symptoms that are similar to the symptoms caused by Horner syndrome. Palatal myoclonus, the twitching of the muscles of the mouth, may be observed due to disruption of the central tegmental tract.

The pain associated with the condition may be severe. Only some variations of Ehlers\u2013Danlos can be positively identified as tied to specific genetic variation. Mutations in the following genes can cause subtypes of the Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome: - Fibrous proteins: COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL5A1, COL5A2, and TNXB - Enzymes: ADAMTS2, PLOD1, B4GALT7, DSE, and D4ST1/CHST14 Mutations in these genes usually alter the structure, production, or processing of collagen or proteins that interact with collagen. Collagen provides structure and strength to connective tissue. A defect in collagen can weaken connective tissue in the skin, bones, blood vessels, and organs, resulting in the features of the disorder. Inheritance patterns depend on the type of Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome. Most forms of the condition are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means only one of the two copies of the gene in question must be altered to cause the disorder.

Children with this disorder do not follow typical patterns of language acquisition and will need treatment in order to make progress. DVD/CAS is a motor disorder, which means that the problem is located in the brain and its signals, and not in the mouth. In most cases, the cause is unknown. Possible causes include genetic syndromes and disorders. Recent research has focused on the significance of the FOXP2 gene in both species and individual development. Research regarding the KE family, where half the members of the extended family, over three generations, exhibited heritable developmental verbal dyspraxia, were found to have a defective copy of the FOXP2 gene. and further studies suggest that the FOXP2 gene as well as other genetic issues could explain DVD/CAS."}

These symptoms often result in double vision and difficulty chewing and swallowing. - Postsynaptic symptoms in infants include severe muscle weakness, feeding and respiratory problems, and delays in the ability to sit, crawl, and walk. - Synaptic symptoms include early childhood feeding and respiratory problems, reduced mobility, curvature of the spine, and weakness, which causes a delay in motor milestones. Onset symptoms for all ages may include droopy eyelids. A particular form of postsynaptic CMS (slow-channel CMS) includes severe weakness beginning in infancy or childhood that progresses and leads to loss of mobility and respiratory problems in adolescence or later life. CMS is associated with genetic defects that affect proteins of the neuromuscular junction. Postsynaptic defects are the most frequent cause of CMS and often result in abnormalities in the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). In the neuromuscular junction there is a vital pathway that maintains synaptic structure and results in the aggregation and localization of AChR on the postsynaptic folds. This pathway consists of agrin, muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK), acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) and the AChR-clustering protein rapsyn, encoded by the RAPSN gene. The vast majority of mutations causing CMS are found in the AChR subunits and rapsyn genes. Out of all mutations associated with CMS, more than half are mutations in one of the four genes encoding the adult acetylcholine receptor (AChR) subunits. Mutations of the AChR often result in endplate deficiency."}

Skin symptoms, which occur in >75% of patients, include erythroderma, pruritis, eczema, Poikiloderma, urticarial, and episodic angioedema. The symptom of episodic angioedema in lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia resembles that occurring in Gleich's syndrome, a rare disease that is accompanied by secondary hypereosinophilia plus a sub-population of CD3(-), CD4(+) T cells and therefore proposed, at least in many patients, a subtype of lymphocyte-variant hypereosiophilia. Biopsies of these erythroderma and eczema skin lesions find prominent accumulations of eosinophils. Other presentations include; a) lymphadenopathy occurring in ~60% of patients; b) eosinophil infiltrations in lung similar to, and often diagnosed as, eosinophilic pneumonia, occurring in ~20% of patients; c) episodic angioedema-related gastrointestinal symptoms that are sometimes similar to symptoms of the irritable bowel syndrome occurring in ~20% of patients; d) rheumatologic manifestations of inflammatory arthralgias in ~20% of patients; and e) splenomegaly occurring in ~10% of patients. Cardiovascular complications such as various types of heart damage (see above History section) and vascular injuries due to eosinophil infiltration and eosinophil-induced thrombosis are often critical components of persistent hypereosinohilia syndromes; These complications are not a prominent component of lymphocyte-variant hypereosionophilia, occurring in <10% of patients. Following the historical findings cited above, studies identified the cytokine, interleukin 5 (IL5), as the eosinophil growth-stimulating CFU made by T cells from patients suffering the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. Subsequent studies likewise identified IL5 as a cytokine being overproduced by certain lymphocytes taken from patients with lymphocyte-variant eosinophilia. In consequence of the initial 1987 study, these studies, and further studies, lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia is viewed as a unique disease characterized by hypereosinophilia secondary to the pathological production of eosinophil growth factors, particularly IL5 but possibly also IL4; IL13, and GM-CSF by aberrant clones of T cells. The aberrant T cell clone, as defined by immunophenotyping their expression of certain cell surface molecules, the cluster of differentiation (i. e. CD) proteins, varies from patient to patient; furthermore, some of these clones also exhibit clonal rearrangements in their T-cell receptor gene.

There are several methods available for diagnosing and monitoring hemosiderosis including: - Serum ferritin - Liver biopsy - MRI Serum ferritin is a low cost, readily available, and minimally invasive method for assessing body iron stores. However, the major problem with using it as an indicator of hemosiderosis is that it can be elevated in a range of other medical conditions unrelated to iron levels including infection, inflammation, fever, liver disease, renal disease and cancer. While liver biopsies provide a direct measure of liver iron concentration, the small sample size relative to the size of the liver can lead to sampling errors given the heterogeneity of iron concentration within the liver. Furthermore, the invasive nature of liver biopsy and the associated risks of complications (which can range from pain, haemorrhage, gallbladder perforation and other morbidities through to death in approx 1 in 10,000 cases) prevent it being used as a regular monitoring tool. MRI is emerging as an alternative method for measuring liver iron loading because it is non-invasive, safer and generally cheaper to perform than liver biopsy; does not suffer from problems with sampling variability; and can be used more frequently than performing liver biopsies."}

More often, individuals will complain of nausea, abdominal pain, and frequent watery and usually foul-smelling diarrhea, accompanied by mucus, blood, rectal pain, and fever. Vomiting, rapid weight-loss, and generalized muscle aches sometimes also accompany dysentery. On rare occasions, the amoebic parasite will invade the body through the bloodstream and spread beyond the intestines. In such cases, it may more seriously infect other organs such as the brain, lungs, and most commonly the liver. Dysentery results from viral, bacterial, or parasitic infestations. These pathogens typically reach the large intestine after entering orally, through ingestion of contaminated food or water, oral contact with contaminated objects or hands, and so on. Each specific pathogen has its own mechanism or pathogenesis, but in general, the result is damage to the intestinal lining, leading to the inflammatory immune response. This can cause elevated temperature, painful spasms of the intestinal muscles (cramping), swelling due to water leaking from capillaries of the intestine (edema), and further tissue damage by the body's immune cells and the chemicals, called cytokines, which are released to fight the infection."}

Highly differentiated adenocarcinomas form SRCCs via a loss of adherens and tight junctions that typically separate MUC4, a mucin protein, and ErbB2, an oncogenic receptor. When MUC4 and ErbB2 are able to interact, they trigger an activation loop. As a result, the ErbB2/ErbB3 signaling pathway becomes constitutively activated, cell-cell interactions are lost and signet carcinomas are formed. Constitutive action of the ErbB2/ErbB3 complex also enhances cell growth. The mechanism of this malignant cancer is still unclear; however, it has been found that a colon carcinoma cell known as HCC2998 causes an increase in differentiated tumor production. The reason for this increase is due to active PI3K that are converted to a SRCC-like cells. The pattern of metastasis is different for gastric signet cell carcinoma than for intestinal-type gastric carcinoma. The SRCC tumor is often seen in the peritoneum and has also been known to spread to lymphatic permeation of the lungs and to the ovaries, creating Krukenberg tumors. Cases of gastric carcinomas metastasizing to the breast and forming signet-ring cells have also been reported. One study suggests that when signet-ring cells are found in a breast tumor, the presence of gastric cancer should also be considered. Some cases are inherited, and these cases are often caused by mutations in the CDH1 gene, which encodes the important cell-cell adhesion glycoprotein E-cadherin. A down-regulation of E-cadherin is essential for the initiation and progression a gastric signet ring cell cancer cells. Once those cells lose E-cadherin, their motility increases due to an epithelial-mesenchymal transition."}

They are inhaled and often provoke the creation of IgE antibodies that circulate in the bloodstream, these types of immune response are most often initiated by exposure to thermophilic actinomycetes (most commonly Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula), which generates IgG-type antibodies. Following a subsequent exposure, IgG antibodies combine with the inhaled allergen to form immune complexes in the walls of the alveoli in the lungs. This causes fluid, protein, and cells to accumulate in the alveolar wall which slows blood-gas interchange and compromises the function of the lung. After multiple exposures, it takes less and less of the antigens to set off the reaction in the lung. The most prominent antigens are thermophilic actinomycetes and fungi. Farmer\u2019s lung reactions can be categorized as acute and chronic reactions. Acute and chronic reactions have the same symptoms but for chronic reactions, the symptoms are much more severe.

In acute attacks, the symptoms mimic pneumonia or flu. In chronic attacks, there is a possibility of the victim going into shock and dying from the attack. Depending on the severity of the symptoms, FLD can last from one to to weeks, or they can last for the rest of one\u2019s life.

Associated complaints or diseases include arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS). Associations with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) have also been reported. Diagnosis is generally by assessment of inflammatory markers in stool followed by colonoscopy with biopsy of pathological lesions. IBD is a complex disease which arises as a result of the interaction of environmental and genetic factors leading to immunological responses and inflammation in the intestine. As a result of microbial symbiosis and immunity, alterations in enteral bacteria may contribute to inflammatory gut diseases. IBD-affected individuals have been found to have 30\u201350 percent reduced biodiversity of commensal bacteria, such as decreases in Firmicutes (namely Lachnospiraceae) and Bacteroidetes. Further evidence of the role of gut flora in the cause of inflammatory bowel disease is that IBD-affected individuals are more likely to have been prescribed antibiotics in the 2\u20135 year period before their diagnosis than unaffected individuals. The enteral bacteria can be altered by environmental factors, such as concentrated milk fats (a common ingredient of processed foods and confectionery) or oral medications such as antibiotics and oral iron preparations. Loss of integrity of the intestinal epithelium plays a key pathogenic role in IBD. Innate immune dysfunction through aberrant TLR signaling contributes to acute and chronic inflammatory processes in IBD colitis and associated cancer. Changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota are an important environmental factor in the development of IBD. Detrimental changes in the intestinal microbiota induce an inappropriate (uncontrolled) immune response that results in damage to the intestinal epithelium."}

A recent review on lumbar stenosis in the Journal of the American Medical Association's \"Rational Clinical Examination Series\" emphasized that the syndrome can be considered when lower extremity pain occurs in combination with back pain. This syndrome occurs in 12% of older community dwelling men and up to 21% of those in retirement communities. The leg symptoms in lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) are similar to those found with vascular claudication, giving rise to the term pseudoclaudication. These symptoms include pain, weakness, and tingling of the legs, which may radiate down the leg to the feet. Additional symptoms in the legs may be fatigue, heaviness, weakness, a sensation of tingling, pricking, or numbness and leg cramps, as well as bladder symptoms. Symptoms are most commonly bilateral and symmetrical, but they may be unilateral; leg pain is usually more troubling than back pain. Pseudoclaudication, now referred to as neurogenic claudication, typically worsen with standing or walking and improve with sitting. The occurrence is often related to posture and lumbar extension. Lying on the side is often more comfortable than lying flat, since it permits greater lumbar flexion. Vascular claudication can resemble spinal stenosis, and some individuals experience unilateral or bilateral symptoms radiating down the legs rather than true claudication. The first symptoms of stenosis include bouts of low back pain. After a few months or years, this may progress to claudication. The pain may be radicular, following the classic neurologic pathways."}

In general symptoms are internal or external bleeding episodes, which are called \"bleeds\". People with more severe haemophilia suffer more severe and more frequent bleeds, while people with mild haemophilia usually suffer more minor symptoms except after surgery or serious trauma. In cases of moderate haemophilia symptoms are variable which manifest along a spectrum between severe and mild forms. In both haemophilia A and B, there is spontaneous bleeding but a normal bleeding time, normal prothrombin time, normal thrombin time, but prolonged partial thromboplastin time. Internal bleeding is common in people with severe haemophilia and some individuals with moderate haemophilia. The most characteristic type of internal bleed is a joint bleed where blood enters into the joint spaces. This is most common with severe haemophiliacs and can occur spontaneously (without evident trauma). If not treated promptly, joint bleeds can lead to permanent joint damage and disfigurement. Bleeding into soft tissues such as muscles and subcutaneous tissues is less severe but can lead to damage and requires treatment. Children with mild to moderate haemophilia may not have any signs or symptoms at birth especially if they do not undergo circumcision.

The use of over-the-counter artificial-tear solutions can reduce the effects of dry eye in CVS. Asthenopic symptoms in the eye are responsible for much of the severity in CVS. Proper rest to the eye and its muscles is recommended to relieve the associated eye strain. Various catch-phrases have been used to spread awareness about giving rest to the eyes while working on computers. A routinely recommended approach is to consciously blink the eyes every now and then (this helps replenish the tear film) and to look out the window to a distant object or to the sky\u2014doing so provides rest to the ciliary muscles. One of the catch phrases is the \"20 20 20 rule\": every 20 mins, focus the eyes on an object 20 feet (6 meters) away for 20 seconds. This basically gives a convenient distance and timeframe for a person to follow the advice from the optometrist and ophthalmologist. Otherwise, the patient is advised to close his/her eyes (which has a similar effect) for 20 seconds, at least every half-hour.

Less commonly, CLL may present with enlarged lymph nodes without a high white blood cell count or no evidence of the disease in the blood. This is referred to as small lymphocytic lymphoma. In some individuals, the disease comes to light only after the cancerous cells overwhelm the bone marrow resulting in anemia producing tiredness or weakness. CLL is caused by multiple genetic mutations and epigenetic changes. Men are about twice as likely to get CLL as women, and risk increases with age. It is relatively rare among Asians. Some relevant genetic mutations may be inherited; in around 9% of CLL cases a parent had CLL. Exposure to Agent Orange increases the risk of CLL, and exposure to certain insecticides may increase the risk. Exposure to ionizing radiation and viral infection have been explored as risk factors but there is little evidence. Blood transfusions have been ruled out as a risk factor. CLL is usually first suspected by a diagnosis of lymphocytosis, an increase in a type of white blood cell, on a complete blood count test.

About 90% of DFSPs are low grade sarcomas. About 10% are mixed; they contain a high-grade sarcomatous component (DFSP-FS); therefore, they are considered to be intermediate-grade sarcomas. DFSPs rarely lead to a metastasis (fewer than 5% do metastasise), but DFSPs can recur locally. DFSPs most often arise in patients who are in their thirties, but sometimes have been described in children or the elderly. More than 90% of DFSP tumors have the chromosomal translocation t(17;22). The translocation fuses the collagen gene (COL1A1) with the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) gene. The fibroblast, the cell of origin of this tumor, expresses the fusion gene in the belief that it codes for collagen. However the resulting fusion protein is processed into mature platelet-derived growth factor which is a potent growth factor. Fibroblasts contain the receptor for this growth factor. Thus the cell \"thinks\" it is producing a structural protein, but it actually produces a self-stimulatory growth signal. The cell divides rapidly and a tumor forms."}

Vomiting may not occur in all cases, as sufferers may adjust their diets to include only small amounts of food. Primary complications of gastroparesis include: - Fluctuations in blood glucose due to unpredictable digestion times (in diabetic patients) - General malnutrition due to the symptoms of the disease (which frequently include vomiting and reduced appetite) as well as the dietary changes necessary to manage it - Severe fatigue and weight loss due to calorie deficit - Intestinal obstruction due to the formation of bezoars (solid masses of undigested food) - Bacterial infection due to overgrowth in undigested food Transient gastroparesis may arise in acute illness of any kind, as a consequence of certain cancer treatments or other drugs which affect digestive action, or due to abnormal eating patterns. It is frequently caused by autonomic neuropathy. This may occur in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. In fact, diabetes mellitus has been named as the most common cause of gastroparesis, as high levels of blood glucose may effect chemical changes in the nerves. The vagus nerve becomes damaged by years of high blood glucose or insufficient transport of glucose into cells resulting in gastroparesis. Gastroparesis has also been associated with connective tissue diseases such as scleroderma and Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome, and neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease. It may also occur as part of a mitochondrial disease. Opioids and anticholinergic medications can cause medication-induced gastroparesis. Chronic gastroparesis can be caused by other types of damage to the vagus nerve, such as abdominal surgery. Heavy cigarette smoking is also a plausible cause since smoking causes damage to the stomach lining. Idiopathic gastroparesis (gastroparesis with no known cause) accounts for a third of all chronic cases; it is thought that many of these cases are due to an autoimmune response triggered by an acute viral infection. Gastroenteritis, mononucleosis, and other ailments have been anecdotally linked to the onset of the condition, but no systematic study has proven a link."}

In Standard Poodles, sebaceous adenitis is most likely an autosomal recessive inherited disease, with variable expression. In general, sebaceous adenitis is underdiagnosed in dogs. Diagnosis confirmation requires multiple punch biopsies analysed by a dermopathologist who will comment on the condition of the sebaceous glands, revealing granulomatous or pyogranulomatous inflammation surrounding the sebaceous glands or even complete destruction of sebaceous glands.

The hives are observed to coincide with perspiration points of sweating.

The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) defines chemophobia as an \"irrational fear of chemicals\". According to the American Council on Science and Health, chemophobia is a fear of synthetic substances arising from \"scare stories\" and exaggerated claims about their dangers prevalent in the media. Despite containing the suffix -phobia, the majority of written work focusing on addressing chemophobia describes it as a non-clinical aversion or prejudice, and not as a phobia in the standard medical definition. Chemophobia is generally addressed by chemical education and public outreach. Michelle Francl has written: \"We are a chemophobic culture. Chemical has become a synonym for something artificial, adulterated, hazardous, or toxic. \" She characterizes chemophobia as \"more like color blindness than a true phobia\" because chemophobics are \"blind\" to most of the chemicals that they encounter: every substance in the universe is a chemical. Francl proposes that such misconceptions are not innocuous, as demonstrated in one case by local statutes opposing the fluoridation of public water despite documented cases of tooth loss and nutritional deficit. In terms of risk perception, naturally occurring chemicals feel safer than synthetic ones to most people. Consequently, people fear man-made or \"unnatural\" chemicals, while accepting natural chemicals that are known to be dangerous or poisonous. The Carcinogenic Potency Project, which is a part of the US EPA's Distributed Structure-Searchable Toxicity (DSSTox) Database Network, has been systemically testing the carcinogenicity of chemicals, both natural and synthetic, and building a publicly available database of the results since the 1980s. Their work attempts to fill in the gaps in our scientific knowledge of the carcinogenicity of all chemicals, both natural and synthetic, as the scientists conducting the Project described in the journal, Science, in 1992: Toxicological examination of synthetic chemicals, without similar examination of chemicals that occur naturally, has resulted in an imbalance in both the data on and the perception of chemical carcinogens.

It is possible for a newborn with this disease to have neutropenia and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia as well. Hemolysis leads to elevated bilirubin levels. After delivery bilirubin is no longer cleared (via the placenta) from the neonate's blood and the symptoms of jaundice (yellowish skin and yellow discoloration of the whites of the eyes) increase within 24 hours after birth. Like other severe neonatal jaundice, there is the possibility of acute or chronic kernicterus, however the risk of kernicterus is higher because of the rapid destruction of blood cells. It is important to note that isoimmunization is a risk factor for neurotoxicity and lowers the level at which kernicterus can occur. Untreated profound anemia can cause high-output heart failure, with pallor, enlarged liver and/or spleen, generalized swelling, and respiratory distress. HDN can be the cause of hydrops fetalis, an often-severe form of prenatal heart failure that causes fetal edema. Antibodies are produced when the body is exposed to an antigen foreign to the make-up of the body. If a mother is exposed to a foreign antigen and produces IgG (as opposed to IgM which does not cross the placenta), the IgG will target the antigen, if present in the fetus, and may affect it in utero and persist after delivery. The three most common models in which a woman becomes sensitized toward (i. e. , produces IgG antibodies against) a particular antigen are hemorrhage, blood transfusion, and ABO incompatibility.

To some extent, the symptoms depend upon the location of the tumor: patients with cholangiocarcinoma in the extrahepatic bile ducts (outside the liver) are more likely to have jaundice, while those with tumors of the bile ducts within the liver more often have pain without jaundice. Blood tests of liver function in patients with cholangiocarcinoma often reveal a so-called \"obstructive picture,\" with elevated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transferase levels, and relatively normal transaminase levels. Such laboratory findings suggest obstruction of the bile ducts, rather than inflammation or infection of the liver parenchyma, as the primary cause of the jaundice. Although most patients present without any known risk factors evident, a number of risk factors for the development of cholangiocarcinoma have been described. In the Western world, the most common of these is primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts which is closely associated with ulcerative colitis (UC). Epidemiologic studies have suggested that the lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma for a person with PSC is on the order of 10%\u201315%, although autopsy series have found rates as high as 30% in this population. Certain parasitic liver diseases may be risk factors as well. Colonization with the liver flukes Opisthorchis viverrini (found in Thailand, Laos PDR, and Vietnam) or Clonorchis sinensis (found in China, Taiwan, eastern Russia, Korea, and Vietnam) has been associated with the development of cholangiocarcinoma. Patients with chronic liver disease, whether in the form of viral hepatitis (e. g. hepatitis B or hepatitis C), alcoholic liver disease, or cirrhosis of the liver due to other causes, are at significantly increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma. HIV infection was also identified in one study as a potential risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma, although it was unclear whether HIV itself or other correlated and confounding factors (e. g."}

In addition, some children with BWS have other findings including: nevus flammeus, prominent occiput, midface hypoplasia, hemihypertrophy, genitourinary anomalies (enlarged kidneys), cardiac anomalies, musculoskeletal abnormalities, and hearing loss. Also, some premature newborns with BWS do not have macroglossia until closer to their anticipated delivery date. Given the variation among individuals with BWS and the lack of a simple diagnostic test, identifying BWS can be difficult. In an attempt to standardize the classification of BWS, DeBaun et al. have defined a child as having BWS if the child has been diagnosed by a physician as having BWS and if the child has at least two of the five common features associated with BWS (macroglossia, macrosomia, midline abdominal wall defects, ear creases/ear pits, neonatal hypoglycemia). Another definition presented by Elliot et al. includes the presence of either three major features (anterior abdominal wall defect, macroglossia, or prepostnatal overgrowth) or two major plus three minor findings (ear pits, nevus flammeus, neonatal hypoglycemia, nephromegaly, or hemihyperplasia). While most children with BWS do not develop cancer, children with BWS do have a significantly increased risk of cancer. Children with BWS are most at risk during early childhood and should receive cancer screening during this time. In general, children with BWS do very well and grow up to become adults of normal size and intelligence, usually without the syndromic features of their childhood. Most children (>80%) with BWS do not develop cancer; however, children with BWS are much more likely (~600 times more) than other children to develop certain childhood cancers, particularly Wilms' tumor (nephroblastoma), pancreatoblastoma and hepatoblastoma. Individuals with BWS appear to only be at increased risk for cancer during childhood (especially before age four) and do not have an increased risk of developing cancer in adulthood.

In 2011, the PRRT2 gene on chromosome 16 was identified as the cause of the disease. The researchers looked at the genetics of eight families with strong histories of PKD. They employed whole genome sequencing, along with Sanger sequencing to identify the gene that was mutated in these families. The mutations in this gene included a nonsense mutation identified in the genome of one family and an insertion mutation identified in the genome of another family. The researchers then confirmed this gene as the cause of PKD when it was not mutated in the genome of 1000 control patients. Researchers found PRRT2 mutations in 10 of 29 sporadic cases affected with PKD, thus suggests PRRT2 is the gene mutated in a subset of PKD and PKD is genetically heterogeneous. The mechanism of how PRRT2 causes PKD still requires further investigation. However, researchers suggest it may have to do with PRRT2's expression in the basal ganglia, and the expression of an associated protein, SNAP25, in the basal ganglia as well. The pathophysiology of PKD is not fully explained. A few mechanisms have been suggested thus far: 1. GABA dysregulation 2. Abnormal breakdown of dopamine in the basal ganglia 3.

Incompatible with this (now obsolete) definition of glaucoma was the ever larger number of cases that have been reported in medical literature in the 1980s and 1990s who had the typical signs of glaucomatous damage, like optic nerve head excavation and thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer, while these patients had an IOP that would generally have been regarded as \"normal\". It is now widely estimated that a larger percentage of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) are suffering from normal tension glaucoma: probably half of all POAG patients in Europe and the majority of POAG patients in East Asia. Among Americans of Japanese descent, for instance, the prevalence of NTG is about four times as high as the prevalence of the \"classical glaucoma\" with an IOP of 22 mm Hg and higher. The pillar of the current understanding of normal tension glaucoma is a reduced IOP tolerance of the retinal ganglion cells and the cells in the optic nerve head - an IOP of, for example, 17 or 19 mm Hg that would not affect a healthy eye leads to damage in the eye of an NTG patient. In many patients, normal tension glaucoma is common in individuals with a generalized reduced perfusion of organs and certain body tissues. A low blood pressure - whether consistently low or with sudden pressure drops - is associated with NTG as are conditions like Flammer syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea. Flammer syndrome has been attributed to increase the likelihood of ganglion cell damage in normal tension glaucoma patients with disc hemorrhages as a characteristic clinical sign. Besides race (Japanese) and low blood pressure, the female gender is also a risk factor. While tonometry, the measuring of IOP and thus a classical instrument in the diagnosis of glaucoma, is not helpful, ophthalmoscopy leads to the diagnosis by showing typical glaucomatous damage, primarily at the optic nerve head, in the absence of elevated IOP. While the excavation of the optic nerve head and the thinning of its rim appear in all kinds of glaucoma (with high tension and with normal tension,in Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and in secondary glaucoma), small hemorrhages close to the optic disc have been identified as a characteristic clinical sign of normal tension glaucoma. Visual field is very important to detect NTG. It shows a defect that typically appear deeper, steeper and closer to fixation comparing to patients with POAG. Since NTG is closely linked to vascular irregularities, a medical check-up by a general practitioner or a specialist in internal medicine is widely recommended in cases of newly diagnosed normal tension glaucoma."}

Many patients get better and do not progress beyond this phase. - A paralytic phase can follow if ischemia continues; in this phase, the abdominal pain becomes more widespread, the belly becomes more tender to the touch, and bowel motility decreases, resulting in abdominal bloating, no further bloody stools, and absent bowel sounds on exam. - Finally, a shock phase can develop as fluids start to leak through the damaged colon lining. This can result in shock and metabolic acidosis with dehydration, low blood pressure, rapid heart rate, and confusion. Patients who progress to this phase are often critically ill and require intensive care. Symptoms of ischemic colitis vary depending on the severity of the ischemia. The most common early signs of ischemic colitis include abdominal pain (often left-sided), with mild to moderate amounts of rectal bleeding. The sensitivity of findings among 73 patients were: - abdominal pain (78%) - lower digestive bleeding (62%) - diarrhea (38%) - Fever higher than (34%) Physical examination - abdominal pain (77%) - abdominal tenderness (21%) Ischemic colitis is often classified according to the underlying cause. Non-occlusive ischemia develops because of low blood pressure or constriction of the vessels feeding the colon; occlusive ischemia indicates that a blood clot or other blockage has cut off blood flow to the colon. In hemodynamically unstable patients (i. e. shock) the mesenteric perfusion may be compromised.

A periodontal abscess represents a change in this balance, related to decreased local or systemic resistance of the host. An inflammatory response occurs when bacteria invade and multiply within the soft tissue of the gingival crevice/periodontal pocket. A pus-filled abscess forms when the immune system responds and attempts to isolate the infection from spreading."}

For a mental state to classify as a disorder, it generally needs to cause dysfunction. Most international clinical documents use the term mental \"disorder\", while \"illness\" is also common. It has been noted that using the term \"mental\" (i. e. , of the mind) is not necessarily meant to imply separateness from brain or body. According to DSM-IV, a mental disorder is a psychological syndrome or pattern which is associated with distress (e. g. via a painful symptom), disability (impairment in one or more important areas of functioning), increased risk of death, or causes a significant loss of autonomy; however it excludes normal responses such as grief from loss of a loved one, and also excludes deviant behavior for political, religious, or societal reasons not arising from a dysfunction in the individual. DSM-IV precedes the definition with caveats, stating that, as in the case with many medical terms, mental disorder \"lacks a consistent operational definition that covers all situations\", noting that different levels of abstraction can be used for medical definitions, including pathology, symptomology, deviance from a normal range, or etiology, and that the same is true for mental disorders, so that sometimes one type of definition is appropriate, and sometimes another, depending on the situation. In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) redefined mental disorders in the DSM-5 as \"a syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying mental functioning. \u201d There are currently two widely established systems that classify mental disorders: - , since 1949 part of the International Classification of Diseases produced by the WHO, - the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) produced by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) since 1952. Both of these list categories of disorder and provide standardized criteria for diagnosis. They have deliberately converged their codes in recent revisions so that the manuals are often broadly comparable, although significant differences remain."}

These experiences may occur directly following insult or may occur several hours or even days afterwards. Note that pain is not a common symptom of nerve entrapment. A nerve may be compressed by prolonged or repeated external force, such as sitting with one's arm over the back of a chair (radial nerve), frequently resting one's elbows on a table (ulnar nerve), or an ill-fitting cast or brace on the leg (peroneal nerve). Part of the patient's body can cause the compression and the term entrapment neuropathy is used particularly in this situation. The offending structure may be a well-defined lesion such as a tumour (for example a lipoma, neurofibroma or metastasis), a ganglion cyst or a haematoma. Alternatively, there may be expansion of the tissues around a nerve in a space where there is little room for this to occur, as is often the case in carpal tunnel syndrome. This may be due to weight gain or peripheral oedema (especially in pregnancy), or to a specific condition such as acromegaly, hypothyroidism or scleroderma and psoriasis. Some conditions cause nerves to be particularly susceptible to compression. These include diabetes, in which the blood supply to the nerves is already compromised, rendering the nerve more sensitive to minor degrees of compression. The genetic condition HNPP is a much rarer cause. External pressure reduces flow in the vessels supplying the nerve with blood (the vasa nervorum). This causes local ischaemia, which has an immediate effect on the ability of the nerve axons to transmit action potentials. As the compression becomes more severe over time, focal demyelination occurs, followed by axonal damage and finally scarring."}

There are several strains of LCM virus, among which the most widely used are LCMV Armstrong and LCMV Clone 13. Armstrong is the original virus strain which was isolated from the brain by Charles Armstrong in 1934. It triggers a vigorous cytotoxic T lymphocytes(CTL) response and thus, it is cleared rapidly by the host. This is referred to as acute (Armstrong) LCMV infection. On the other hand, Clone 13 is a variant of the Armstrong viral strain, isolated from the spleen and is consequently tropic for visceral organs. It was first isolated from mice which sustained a persistent LCMV infection from birth. This variant potentiates a less vigorous CTL response in the immune system, and thus can ultimately persist in the host organism indefinitely. The latter is referred to as chronic (Clone 13) LCMV infection. LCMV is a spherical enveloped virus with a diameter between 60 and 300 nm. The helical nucleocapsid contains an RNA genome consisting of two negative single-stranded RNA segments.

The syndrome has neuromuscular and endocrine manifestations. Early signs often include weakness of tongue and mouth muscles, fasciculations, and gradually increasing weakness of limb muscles with muscle wasting. Neuromuscular management is supportive, and the disease progresses very slowly, but can eventually lead to extreme disability. Further signs and symptoms include: Homozygous females, both of whose X chromosomes have a mutation leading to CAG expansion of the AR gene, have been reported to show only mild symptoms of muscle cramps and twitching. No endocrinopathy has been described. The genetics of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy have to do with the mutated androgen receptor gene located on the X chromosome. The effects of the mutation may be androgen-dependent, thus only males are fully affected. Females are rarely affected; female carriers tend to have a relatively mild expression of the disease if they show symptoms at all. The mechanism behind SBMA is caused by expansion of a CAG repeat in the first exon of the androgen receptor gene (trinucleotide repeats). The CAG repeat encodes a polyglutamine tract in the androgen receptor protein. The greater the expansion of the CAG repeat, the earlier the disease onset and more severe the disease manifestations. The repeat expansion likely causes a toxic gain of function in the receptor protein, since loss of receptor function in androgen insensitivity syndrome does not cause motor neuron degeneration."}

Dehydration is common, and incontinence can occur secondary to chronic bladder distension. On investigation, there will be an increased plasma osmolarity and decreased urine osmolarity. As pituitary function is normal, ADH levels are likely to be abnormal or raised. Polyuria will continue as long as the patient is able to drink. If the patient is unable to drink and is still unable to concentrate the urine, then hypernatremia will ensue with its neurologic symptoms. Nephrogenic DI (NDI) is most common in its acquired forms, meaning that the defect was not present at birth. These acquired forms have numerous potential causes. The most obvious cause is a kidney or systemic disorder, including amyloidosis, polycystic kidney disease, electrolyte imbalance, or some other kidney defect. The major causes of acquired NDI that produce clinical symptoms (e. g. polyuria) in the adult are lithium toxicity and high blood calcium. Chronic lithium ingestion \u2013 appears to affect the tubules by entering the collecting tubule cells through sodium channels, accumulating and interfering with the normal response to ADH (ADH resistance) in a mechanism that is not yet fully understood. High blood calcium causes natriuresis (increased sodium loss in the urine) and water diuresis, in part by its effect through the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR)."}

In more recent times, the terms \"Mikulicz's disease\" and \"Mikulicz's syndrome\" were viewed as ambiguous and outdated by some sources. Today Mikulicz's disease is considered to be a subtype of IgG4-related disease, usually accompanied by involvement of one or more other organs in the body.

Even if enlarged adenoids are not substantial enough to physically block the back of the nose, they can obstruct airflow enough so that breathing through the nose requires an uncomfortable amount of work, and inhalation occurs instead through an open mouth. Adenoids can also obstruct the nasal airway enough to affect the voice without actually stopping nasal airflow altogether. Nasal blockage is determined by at least two factors: 1) the size of the adenoids, and 2) the size of the nasal pharynx passageway. The adenoid usually reaches its greatest size by about age 5 years or so, and then fades away (\"atrophies\") by late childhood - generally by the age of 7 years. The lymphoid tissue remains under the mucosa of the nasopharynx, and could be seen under a microscope if the area was biopsied, but the mass is so reduced in size that the roof of the nasopharynx becomes flat rather than mounded. Just as the size of the adenoids is variable between individuals, so is the age at which adenoids atrophy. The symptoms caused by enlarged adenoids are mostly due to where this lymphoid tissue is located. The adenoids are in the midline of the nasopharynx, and the Eustachian tubes open from either ear to the right and left of them. In children with excessive middle ear infections and chronic middle ear fluid, there is a high bacterial count in the adenoids as compared to children without problematic otitis media, even if the size of the adenoids is small. The adenoids in these cases provides a reservoir of pathogenic bacteria that cause ear infections and subsequent middle ear effusions (fluid). The nasopharynx lies right above the throat. Splashes of excessive \"drip\" from infected adenoids may land directly on the vocal cords. Although the larynx and vocal cords do not ordinarily become infected from adenoiditis, their mucosa does become irritated."}

Boder assisted in identifying the term musselman when in 1946 he conducted interviews with camp survivors in Europe.

Primo Levi tried to explain the term (he also uses Musselman), in a footnote of If This Is a Man, his autobiographical account of his time in Auschwitz: This word \u2018Muselmann\u2019, I do not know why, was used by the old ones of the camp to describe the weak, the inept, those doomed to selection. The psychologist and Auschwitz survivor Viktor Frankl, in his book Man's Search for Meaning, provides the example of a prisoner who decides to use up his last cigarettes (used as currency in the concentration camps) in the evening because he is convinced he won't survive the Appell (roll call assembly) the next morning; his fellow captives derided him as a Muselmann. Frankl compares this to the dehumanized behavior and attitudes of the kapos. The testimonial of the Polish witness, Adolf Gawalewicz, Refleksje z poczekalni do gazu: ze wspomnie\u0144 muzu\u0142mana (\"Reflections in the Gas Chamber's Waiting Room: From the Memoirs of a Muselmann\"), published in 1968, incorporates the term in the title of the work. Canadian Jewish author Eli Pfefferkorn published a novel in 2011 with title The M\u00fcselmann at the Water Cooler. The term spread from Auschwitz-Birkenau to other concentration camps. Its equivalent in the Majdanek concentration camp was Gamel (derived from German gammeln - colloquial for \"rotting\") and in the Stutthof concentration camp, Krypel (derived from German Kr\u00fcppel, \"cripple\"). When prisoners reached this emaciated condition, they were selected by camp doctors and murdered by gas, bullet or various other methods. Those prisoners considered Muselm\u00e4nner and thus unable to work were also very likely to be labelled \"excess ballast\" inside the concentration camps. In spring 1941 Heinrich Himmler expressed his desire to relieve concentration camps of sick prisoners and those no longer able to work. Action T4, an \"euthanasia\" programme for mentally ill, disabled and other inmates of hospitals and nursing homes who were deemed unworthy of life, was extended to include the weakest concentration-camp prisoners."}

The disorder is also regularly found in captive-bred animals fed on high fish diets, such as mink, pigs and poultry. It shows as a rubber-like hardening of fat reserves which then become unavailable for normal metabolism, resulting in extreme pain, loss of mobility and death. It is thought to be brought about by any or a combination of a number of factors which include: - Vitamin E deficiency - Microcystin poisoning - Heavy metals and other pollutants such as DDT, PCBs, PCDDs and brominated flame retardants - Ingestion of affected animals - Pathogens as yet unidentified \\ In 2008 about 170 crocodile deaths in the Olifants Gorge on the Olifants, and in the Letaba Rivers in the eastern part of the Kruger National Park in South Africa, alerted rangers and researchers to a problem that may eventually reach epidemic proportions. Dead and dying bottom-feeding catfish Clarias gariepinus that had ingested toxic pollutants such as heavy metals, had become an easy source of food for the crocodiles, with a resulting transfer of the toxins. With the onset of winter and lower temperatures, metabolism switches to fat reserves, at which time mortality peaks. These particular toxins are from the upper reaches of the river, originating from the industrial and mining complex in the Witbank and Middelburg area. Earlier, in 2007, at the Loskop Dam, higher in the Olifants River, crocodile deaths were linked to a mass die-off of fish after sewage pollution caused cyanobacterial blooms. The affected crocodiles had consumed masses of dead and dying fish. Cyanobacterial blooms (Anabaena spp. ) are common in the stagnant water of dams, but do not occur in the flowing water of rivers. High autumnal mortality among migratory herons and caused by cyanobacterial blooms, is seen regularly in brackish impoundments at Chesapeake Bay in the United States. The Massingir Dam in Mozambique, and just downstream of the Olifants Gorge, was constructed in the 1970s, but the country's civil war delayed installation of the sluice gates.

Hermansky\u2013Pudlak syndrome also impairs vision. - Bleeding disorders: Individuals with the syndrome have platelet dysfunction. Since platelets are necessary for blood clotting, individuals will bruise and bleed easily. - Cellular storage disorders: The syndrome causes a wax-like substance (ceroid) to accumulate in the body tissues and cause damage, especially in the lungs and kidneys. It is also associated with granulomatous colitis, , an inflammation of the colon, and with pulmonary fibrosis, a potentially fatal lung disease. HPS can be caused by mutations in several genes: HPS1, HPS3, HPS4, HPS5, HPS6 and HPS7. HPS type 2, which includes immunodeficiency in its phenotype, is caused by mutation in the AP3B1 gene. HPS type 7 may result from a mutation in the gene coding for dysbindin protein. Hermansky\u2013Pudlak syndrome is thought to be inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait.

In infants, feeding difficulties and poor weight gain are also frequent symptoms. In some cases of SMA syndrome, severe malnutrition accompanying spontaneous wasting may occur. This, in turn, increases the duodenal compression, which worsens the underlying cause, creating a cycle of worsening symptoms. \"Food fear\" is a common development among patients with the chronic form of SMA syndrome. For many, symptoms are partially relieved when in the left lateral decubitus or knee-to-chest position, or in the prone (face down) position. A Hayes maneuver (pressure applied below the umbilicus in cephalad and dorsal direction) elevates the root of the SMA, also slightly easing the constriction. Symptoms can be aggravated when leaning to the right or taking a supine (face up) position. Retroperitoneal fat and lymphatic tissue normally serve as a cushion for the duodenum, protecting it from compression by the SMA. SMA syndrome is thus triggered by any condition involving an insubstantial cushion and narrow mesenteric angle. SMA syndrome can present in two forms: chronic/congenital or acute/induced. Patients with the chronic, congenital form of SMA syndrome predominantly have a lengthy or even lifelong history of abdominal complaints with intermittent exacerbations depending on the degree of duodenal compression. Risk factors include anatomic characteristics such as: aesthenic (very thin or \"lanky\") body build, an unusually high insertion of the duodenum at the ligament of Treitz, a particularly low origin of the SMA, or intestinal malrotation around an axis formed by the SMA. Predisposition is easily aggravated by any of the following: poor motility of the digestive tract, retroperitional tumors, loss of appetite, malabsorption, cachexia, exaggerated lumbar lordosis, visceroptosis, abdominal wall laxity, peritoneal adhesions, abdominal trauma, rapid linear adolescent growth spurt, weight loss, starvation, catabolic states (as with cancer and burns), and history of neurological injury."}

Myhre syndrome is due to mutations in the SMAD4 gene. This gene encodes a protein - transducer mediating transforming growth factor beta. Some researchers believe that the SMAD4 gene mutations that cause Myhre syndrome impair the ability of the SMAD4 protein to attach (bind) properly with the other proteins involved in the signaling pathway. Other studies have suggested that these mutations result in an abnormally stable SMAD4 protein that remains active in the cell longer. Changes in SMAD4 binding or availability may result in abnormal signaling in many cell types, which affects development of several body systems and leads to the signs and symptoms of Myhre syndrome. The patients of this disease exhibit hypertrophic phenotype in their muscle tissues. Myostatin target genes are found to be downregulated while bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) target genes display both upregulated and downregulated genotypes. This disorder was first reported in 1981. It has many similarities to LAPS Syndrome and they both arise from the same mutations in the SMAD4 gene. It is believed that they are the same syndrome."}

For reasons unknown females are twice as likely to have Jacobsen Syndrome than males. No preference for any race or ethnicity has been reported so far. Jacobsen Syndrome is caused due to deletion of genetic material from the long arm of chromosome 11. The size of deletion may vary across patients but the deletion always occurs at the end terminal of the q arm of chromosome 11. There are three ways in which the deletion could occur: de novo deletion- this is a random event that occurred during the formation of the sperm or the egg or during the cell division in the embryonic stage, where genes from chromosome 11 get deleted. Imbalanced translocation- in this case a parent with balanced translocation or other types of chromosomal rearrangement can pass on these genes to their children which further results in an imbalanced translocation. In this case the affected children have deletions on chromosome 11 as well as some extra genetic material from another chromosome.

Coital risk factors are: - Uterine contractions - Sperm, carrying organisms upward The bacteria most associated with salpingitis are: - N. gonorrhoeae - Chlamydia trachomatis - Mycoplasma - Staphylococcus - Streptococcus However, salpingitis is usually polymicrobial, involving many kinds of organisms. Other examples of organisms involved are: - Ureaplasma urealyticum - Anaerobic and aerobic bacteria Over one million cases of acute salpingitis are reported every year in the US, but the number of incidents is probably larger, due to incomplete and untimely reporting methods and that many cases are reported first when the illness has gone so far that it has developed chronic complications. For women age 16\u201325, salpingitis is the most common serious infection. It affects approximately 11% of females of reproductive age. Salpingitis has a higher incidence among members of lower socioeconomic classes. However, this is thought of being an effect of earlier sex debut, multiple partners, and decreased ability to receive proper health care rather than any independent risk factor for salpingitis. As an effect of an increased risk due to multiple partners, the prevalence of salpingitis is highest for people age 15\u201324 years."}

These may include: sensory, visual, psychic, autonomic, olfactory or motor phenomena. In a complex partial seizure a person may appear confused or dazed and can not respond to questions or direction. Focal seizure may become generalized. Jerking activity may start in a specific muscle group and spread to surrounding muscle groups\u2014known as a Jacksonian march. Unusual activities that are not consciously created may occur. These are known as automatisms and include simple activities like smacking of the lips or more complex activities such as attempts to pick something up. There are six main types of generalized seizures: tonic-clonic, tonic, clonic, myoclonic, absence, and atonic seizures.

Elephantiasis affects mainly the lower extremities, while the ears, mucous membranes, and amputation stumps are affected less frequently. However, different species of filarial worms tend to affect different parts of the body; Wuchereria bancrofti can affect the legs, arms, vulva, breasts, and scrotum (causing hydrocele formation), while Brugia timori rarely affects the genitals. Those who develop the chronic stages of elephantiasis are usually free from microfilariae (amicrofilaraemic), and often have adverse immunological reactions to the microfilariae, as well as the adult worms. The subcutaneous worms present with rashes, urticarial papules, and arthritis, as well as hyper- and hypopigmentation macules. Onchocerca volvulus manifests itself in the eyes, causing \"river blindness\" (onchocerciasis), one of the leading causes of blindness in the world. Serous cavity filariasis presents with symptoms similar to subcutaneous filariasis, in addition to abdominal pain, because these worms are also deep-tissue dwellers. Human filarial nematode worms have complicated life cycles, which primarily consists of five stages. After the male and female worms mate, the female gives birth to live microfilariae by the thousands. The microfilariae are taken up by the vector insect (intermediate host) during a blood meal. In the intermediate host, the microfilariae molt and develop into third-stage (infective) larvae. Upon taking another blood meal, the vector insect injects the infectious larvae into the dermis layer of the skin. After about one year, the larvae molt through two more stages, maturing into the adult worms."}

These symptoms of chickenpox appear 10 to 21 days after exposure to a contagious person. Adults may have a more widespread rash and longer fever, and they are more likely to experience complications, such as varicella pneumonia. Because watery nasal discharge containing live virus usually precedes both exanthem (external rash) and enanthem (oral ulcers) by 1 to 2 days, the infected person actually becomes contagious one to two days before recognition of the disease. Contagiousness persists until all vesicular lesions have become dry crusts (scabs), which usually entails four or five days, by which time nasal shedding of live virus ceases.

Neurological symptoms, such as developmental decline, hypotonia, and mental retardation have also been reported. The disorder is caused by a mutation of the purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) gene, located at chromosome 14q13. 1. PNP is a key enzyme in the purine salvage pathway, and is required for purine degradation. Specifically, it catalyzes the conversion of inosine to hypoxanthine and guanosine to guanine (both guanine and hypoxanthine will be made into xanthine which will then become uric acid). A deficiency of it leads to buildup of elevated deoxy-GTP (dGTP) levels resulting in T-cell toxicity and deficiency. In contrast to adenosine deaminase deficiency (another deficiency of purine metabolism), there is minimal disruption to B cells. PNP deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome (chromosome 14 is an autosome), and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder. PNP-deficiency is extremely rare. Only 33 patients with the disorder in the United States have been documented."}

Indeed, studies indicate that, among family members with the identical congenital hypofibrinogenemia mutation, some never exhibit symptoms and those that are symptomatic develop symptoms only as adults. Individuals with this disorder are usually less symptomatic than patients with other fibrinogen disorders because their fibrinogen levels are generally sufficient to prevent spontaneous bleeding. Those with particularly low blood fibrinogen levels (<0. 5 gram/liter) may develop serious bleeding spontaneously and many with the disorder do so following trauma or surgery. Depending on their fibrinogen levels, women with the disorder may also bleed excessively during delivery and the postpartum period; in rare cases, they may have an increased risk of suffering miscarriages. Individuals with the disorder also suffer thrombotic events which may include blockage of large arteries in relatively young patients who have high levels of cardiovascular risk factors. The thrombi which form in these individuals are unstable, tend to embolize, and may therefore lead to thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism. Both bleeding and thrombotic events can occur at separate times or even concurrently in the same individual with the disorder.

Typically this disease is found in sexually active women but sexually inexperienced, virginal girls have rarely been found with this infection. The development of TOA is thought to begin with the pathogens spreading from the cervix to the endometrium, through the salpinx, into the peritoneal cavity and forming the tubo-ovarian abscess with (in some cases) pelvic peritonitis. TOA can develop from the lymphatic system with infection of the parametrium from an intrauterine device (IUD). Bacteria recovered from TOAs are Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus, Peptococcus, and aerobic streptococci. Long term IUD use is associated with TOA. Actinomyces is also recovered from TOA. Laparoscopy and other imaging tools can visualize the abscess. Physicians are able to make the diagnosis if the abscess ruptures when the woman begins to have lower abdominal pain that then begins to spread. The symptoms then become the same as the symptoms for peritonitis. Sepsis, occurs if left untreated. Ultrasonography is a sensitive enough imaging tool that it can accurately differentiate between pregnancy, hemorrhagic ovarian cysts, endometriosis, ovarian torsion, and tubo-ovarian abscess.

For SPB the most common presenting symptom is that of pain in the affected bone. Back pain and other consequences of the bone lesion may occur such as spinal cord compression or pathological fracture. Around 85% of extramedullary plasmacytoma presents within the upper respiratory tract mucosa, causing possible symptoms such as epistaxis, rhinorrhoea and nasal obstruction.

The diagnosis of plasmacytoma uses a diverse range of interdisciplinary techniques including serum protein electrophoresis, bone marrow biopsy, urine analysis for Bence Jones protein and complete blood count, plain film radiography, MRI and PET-CT. Serum protein electrophoresis separates the proteins in the liquid part of the blood (serum), allowing the analysis of antibodies. Normal blood serum contains a range of antibodies and are said to be polyclonal, whereas serum from a person with plasmacytoma may show a monoclonal spike. This is due to an outgrowth of a single type of plasma cell that forms the plasmacytoma and produces a single type of antibody.

It may also result in a musty smell and lighter skin. Babies born to mothers who have poorly treated PKU may have heart problems, a small head, and low birth weight. Because the mother's body is able to break down phenylalanine during pregnancy, infants with PKU are normal at birth. The disease is not detectable by physical examination at that time, because no damage has yet been done. However, a blood test can reveal elevated phenylalanine levels after one or two days of normal infant feeding. This is the purpose of newborn screening, to detect the disease with a blood test before any damage is done, so that treatment can prevent the damage from happening. If a child is not diagnosed during the routine newborn screening test (typically performed 2\u20137 days after birth, using samples drawn by neonatal heel prick), and a phenylalanine restricted diet is not introduced, then phenylalanine levels in the blood will increase over time. Toxic levels of phenylalanine (and insufficient levels of tyrosine) can interfere with infant development in ways which have permanent effects. The disease may present clinically with seizures, hypopigmentation (excessively fair hair and skin), and a \"musty odor\" to the baby's sweat and urine (due to phenylacetate, a carboxylic acid produced by the oxidation of phenylketone). In most cases, a repeat test should be done at approximately two weeks of age to verify the initial test and uncover any phenylketonuria that was initially missed. Untreated children often fail to attain early developmental milestones, develop microcephaly, and demonstrate progressive impairment of cerebral function.

Sexologists have been using the term hypersexuality since the late 1800s, when Krafft-Ebing described several cases of extreme sexual behaviours in his seminal 1886 book, Psychopathia Sexualis. The author used the term \"hypersexuality\" to describe conditions that would now be termed premature ejaculation. Terms to describe males with the condition include donjuanist, satyromaniac and satyriasist, for women nymphomaniac, while hypersexualist, onanist, hyperphiliac and 'erotomaniac are gender neutral terms. Other, mostly historical, names include Don Juanism, the Messalina complex, and nymphomania. There is little consensus among experts as to the causes of hypersexuality. Some research suggests that some cases can be linked to biochemical or physiological changes that accompany dementia. Psychological needs also complicate the biological explanation, which identifies the temporal/frontal lobe of the brain as the area for regulating libido. Persons suffering from injuries to this part of the brain are at increased risk for aggressive behavior and other behavioral problems including personality changes and socially inappropriate sexual behavior such as hypersexuality. The same symptom can occur after unilateral temporal lobotomy. There are other biological factors that are associated with hypersexuality such as premenstrual changes, and the exposure to virilising hormones in childhood or in utero. In research involving use of anti-androgens to reduce undesirable sexual behaviour such as hypersexuality, testosterone has been found to be necessary, but not sufficient, for sexual drive.

A history of heartburn, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and use of certain forms of medication can raise the suspicion for peptic ulcer. Medicines associated with peptic ulcer include NSAIDs (non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs) that inhibit cyclooxygenase, and most glucocorticoids (e. g. dexamethasone and prednisolone). In people over the age of 45 with more than two weeks of the above symptoms, the odds for peptic ulceration are high enough to warrant rapid investigation by esophagogastroduodenoscopy. The timing of the symptoms in relation to the meal may differentiate between gastric and duodenal ulcers: A gastric ulcer would give epigastric pain during the meal, as gastric acid production is increased as food enters the stomach. Symptoms of duodenal ulcers would initially be relieved by a meal, as the pyloric sphincter closes to concentrate the stomach contents, therefore acid is not reaching the duodenum. Duodenal ulcer pain would manifest mostly 2\u20133 hours after the meal, when the stomach begins to release digested food and acid into the duodenum. Also, the symptoms of peptic ulcers may vary with the location of the ulcer and the person's age.

This disease is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means the defective gene is located on an autosome, and both parents must have one copy of the defective gene in order to have a child born with the disorder. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers, but are usually not affected by the disorder. Giant axonal neuropathy usually appears in infancy or early childhood, and is progressive. Early signs of the disorder often present in the peripheral nervous system, causing individuals with this disorder to have problems walking. Later, normal sensation, coordination, strength, and reflexes become affected. Hearing or vision problems may also occur. Abnormally kinky hair is characteristic of giant axonal neuropathy, appearing in almost all cases. As the disorder progresses, central nervous system becomes involved, which may cause a gradual decline in mental function, loss of control of body movement, and seizures."}

These mutations do not allow GPIb-IX-V complex to bind to the von Willebrand factor, which in turn is what would help platelets adhere to a site of injury which eventually helps stop bleeding. In terms of diagnosis Bernard\u2013Soulier syndrome is characterized by prolonged bleeding time, thrombocytopenia, increased megakaryocytes, and enlarged platelets, Bernard\u2013Soulier syndrome is associated with quantitative or qualitative defects of the platelet glycoprotein complex GPIb/V/IX. The degree of thrombocytopenia may be estimated incorrectly, due to the possibility that when the platelet count is performed with automatic counters, giant platelets may reach the size of red blood cells. The large platelets and low platelet count in BSS are seemingly due to the absence of GPIb\u03b1 and the filamin A binding site that links the GPIb-IX-V complex to the platelet membrane skeleton. The differential diagnosis for Bernard\u2013Soulier syndrome includes both Glanzmann thrombasthenia and pediatric Von Willebrand disease. BSS platelets do not aggregate to ristocetin, and this defect is not corrected by the addition of normal plasma, distinguishing it from von Willebrand disease. In terms of treatment/management, bleeding events can be controlled by platelet transfusion. Most heterozygotes, with few exceptions, do not have a bleeding diathesis. BSS presents as a bleeding disorder due to the inability of platelets to bind and aggregate at sites of vascular endothelial injury. In the event of an individual with mucosal bleeding tranexamic acid can be given. The affected individual may need to avoid contact sports and medications such as aspirin, which can increase the possibility of bleeding. A potential complication is the possibility of the individual producing antiplatelet antibodies The frequency of Bernard\u2013Soulier syndrome is approximately 1 in 1,000,000 people.

Sometimes warts may cause itching, redness, or discomfort, especially when they occur around the anus. Although they are usually without other physical symptoms, an outbreak of genital warts may cause psychological distress, such as anxiety, in some people. HPV is most commonly transmitted through penetrative sex. While HPV can also be transmitted via non-penetrative sexual activity, it is less transmissible than via penetrative sex. There is conflicting evidence about the effect of condoms on transmission of low-risk HPV. Some studies have suggested that they are effective at reducing transmission."}

If there is doubt about the interpretation of the x-ray, stress x-rays, tomograms or CT scan may be used for confirmation. The reasons for non-union are - avascular necrosis (the blood supply was interrupted by the fracture) - the two ends are not apposed (that is, they are not next to each other) - infection (particularly osteomyelitis) - the fracture is not fixed (that is, the two ends are still mobile) - soft-tissue imposition (there is muscle or ligament covering the broken ends and preventing them from touching each other) Callus is formed, but the bone fractures have not joined. This can be due to inadequate fixation of the fracture, and treated with rigid immobilisation. No callus is formed. This is often due to impaired bony healing, for example due to vascular causes (e. g. impaired blood supply to the bone fragments) or metabolic causes (e. g. diabetes or smoking). Failure of initial union, for example when bone fragments are separated by soft tissue may also lead to atrophic non-union."}

Metastasis of early melanoma is possible, but relatively rare: less than a fifth of melanomas diagnosed early become metastatic. Brain metastases are particularly common in patients with metastatic melanoma. It can also spread to the liver, bones, abdomen or distant lymph nodes. Melanomas are usually caused by DNA damage resulting from exposure to ultraviolet light from the sun. Genetics also plays a role. Having more than fifty moles indicates an increased risk melanoma might arise. A weakened immune system makes it easier for cancer to arise due to the body\u2019s weakened ability to fight cancer cells. The ultraviolet radiation from tanning beds increases the risk of melanoma. The International Agency for Research on Cancer finds that tanning beds are \"carcinogenic to humans\" and that people who begin using tanning devices before the age of thirty years are 75% more likely to develop melanoma. Those who work in airplanes also appear to have an increased risk, believed to be due to greater exposure to UV. Ultraviolet UVB light (wavelengths between 315 \u2013 280 nm) from the sun is absorbed by skin cell DNA and results in a type of direct DNA damage called cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs)."}

It is one causative agent of Potter sequence. This absence of kidneys causes oligohydramnios, a deficiency of amniotic fluid in a pregnant woman, which can place extra pressure on the developing baby and cause further malformations. The condition is frequently, but not always the result of a genetic disorder, and is more common in infants born to one or more parents with a malformed or absent kidney. This is much more common, but is not usually of any major health consequence, as long as the other kidney is healthy. It may be associated with an increased incidence of M\u00fcllerian duct abnormalities, which are abnormalities of the development of the female reproductive tract and can be a cause of infertility, blocked menstrual flow (hematocolpos), increased need for Caesarean sections, or other problems. Herlyn-Werner-Wunderlich syndrome is one such syndrome in which unilaterial renal agenesis is combined with a blind hemivagina and uterus didelphys. Up to 40% of women with a urogenital tract anomaly also have an associated renal tract anomaly. Adults with unilateral renal agenesis have considerably higher chances of hypertension (high blood pressure). People with this condition are advised to approach contact sports with caution. The odds of a person being born with unilateral renal agenesis are approximately 1 in 750. In 2008 researchers found autosomal dominant mutations in the RET and GDNF genes to be linked to renal agenesis in unrelated stillborn fetuses through PCR and direct sequence analysis. In the study, DNA from 33 stillborn fetuses were sequenced for mutations in RET, GDNF and GFRA1. Nineteen of the fetuses had BRA, ten had URA and 4 had congenital renal dysplasia."}

Irrespective of disease process, alterations to the valve occur that produce one or a combination of these conditions. Insufficiency and regurgitation are synonymous terms that describe an inability of the valve to prevent backflow of blood as leaflets of the valve fail to join (coapt) correctly. Stenosis is characterized by a narrowing of the valvular orifice that prevents adequate outflow of blood. Stenosis can also result in insufficiency if thickening of the annulus or leaflets results in inappropriate leaf closure. Aortic and mitral valve disease are termed left heart diseases. Diseases of these valves are more prevalent than disease of the pulmonary or tricuspid valve due to the higher pressures the left heart experiences. Stenosis of the aortic valve is characterized by a thickening of the valvular annulus or leaflets that limits the ability of blood to be ejected from the left ventricle into the aorta. It is typically the result of aging, occurring in 2. 8% of the population over 75 years of age and represents the most common cause of outflow obstruction in the left ventricle. Stenosis is typically the result of valvular calcification, but may be the result of a congenitally malformed bicuspid aortic valve. This defect is characterized by the presence of only two valve leaflets and affects up to 1% of the population, making it one of the most common cardiac abnormalities. It may occur in isolation or in concert with other cardiac anomalies. Aortic insufficiency, or regurgitation, is characterized by an inability of the valve leaflets to appropriately close at end systole, thus allowing blood to flow inappropriately backwards into the left ventricle."}

In this case some diagnostic indicators like asymmetric folds and leg-length inequality do not apply. - In unilateral dysplasia only one joint shows deformity, the contralateral side may show resulting effects. In the majority of unilateral cases the left hip has the dysplasia. If the joint is fully dislocated a false acetabulum often forms (often higher up on the pelvis) opposite the dislocated femoral head position. In acetabular dysplasia the acetabulum (socket) is too shallow or deformed. The center-edge angle is measured as described by Wiberg. Two forms of femoral dysplasia are coxa vara, in which the femur head grows at too narrow an angle to the shaft, and coxa valga, in which the angle is too wide.

A summary of clinical manifestations of each syndrome can be found below, in the section labelled \"Clinical presentation\". BFP appears to be a symmetrical polymicrogyria that extends anteriorly from the frontal poles to the posterior precentral gyrus, and inferiorly to the frontal operculum. Patients who had polymicrogyria distribution similar to this also experienced similar symptoms including delayed motor and language developments, spastic hemiparesis or quadriparesis, and forms of mild mental retardation. BFPP was one of the first discovered forms of polymicrogyria to have a gene identified linking to the syndromes caused. This gene is called GPR56. Symmetrical distribution is also evident in this form, but more distinctly, patients with BFPP were found to have atrophy of the cerebellum and brain stem, as well as bilateral white matter abnormalities. BFPP is characterized by estopia, global development delay, pyramidal signs, cerebral signs, and seizures. Estopia is also known as dysconjugate gaze, and is a common feature of severe static encephalopathy. This differentiates BFPP from the other bilatieral polymicrogyria syndromes. BPP is similar to the other types of polymicrogyria in that it is usually symmetrical, but BPP can vary among patients. BPP is characterized by its location; the cerebral cortex deep in the sylvian fissures is thickened and abnormally infolded, as well as the sylvian fissures extending more posteriorly up to the parietal lobes and more vertically oriented. BPP has been classified into a grading system consisting of four different grades that describe that variations in severity: Grade 1: Perisylvian polymicrogyria extends to either one or both poles Grade 2: Perisylvian polymicrogyria extends past the perisylvian region, but not to either of the polesGrade 3: Perisylvian polymicrogyria is contained in the perisylvian region onlyGrade 4: Perisylvian polymicrogyria is contained in the posterior perisylvian region onlyThe grades move from most severe (Grade 1) to least severe (Grade 4)."}

Sexual dysfunction can also occur secondary to major psychiatric disorders, including depression. A substantial body of research has explored the role of interpersonal factors in female sexual dysfunction, particularly in relation to orgasmic response. These studies have largely focused on the impact of the quality of the relationship on the sexual functioning of the partners. Some studies have evaluated the role of specific relationship variables, whereas others have examined overall relationship satisfaction. Some studies have explored events, while others have focused on attitudes as an empirical measure of relationship functioning.

The pain is continuous and may be described as extreme, growing, sharp, shooting, or throbbing. Putting pressure or warmth on the tooth may induce extreme pain. The area may be sensitive to touch and possibly swollen as well. This swelling may be present at either the base of the tooth, the gum, and/or the cheek, and sometimes can be reduced by applying ice packs. An acute abscess may be painless but still have a swelling present on the gum. It is important to get anything that presents like this checked by a dental professional as it may become chronic later. In some cases, a tooth abscess may perforate bone and start draining into the surrounding tissues creating local facial swelling. In some cases, the lymph glands in the neck will become swollen and tender in response to the infection. It may even feel like a migraine as the pain can transfer from the infected area. The pain does not normally transfer across the face, only upwards or downwards as the nerves that serve each side of the face are separate. Severe aching and discomfort on the side of the face where the tooth is infected is also fairly common, with the tooth itself becoming unbearable to touch due to extreme amounts of pain.

The characteristic features of 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type I include speech delay, delayed development of both mental and motor skills (psychomotor delay), elevated levels of acid in the blood and tissues (metabolic acidosis), abnormal muscle tone (dystonia), and spasms and weakness affecting the arms and legs (spastic quadriparesis). Fewer than 20 cases of 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type I have been reported. Barth syndrome is a common name for 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type II. The main features of Barth syndrome include a weakened and enlarged heart (dilated cardiomyopathy), recurrent infections due to low numbers of white blood cells (neutropenia), skeletal problems, and delayed growth. The incidence of 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type II is approximately 1 in 200,000 male infants. Costeff optic atrophy syndrome is another name for 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type III. This disorder is characterized mainly by the degeneration of the optic nerves, which carry information from the eyes to the brain. Sometimes other nervous system problems occur, such as an inability to maintain posture, poor muscle tone, the development of certain involuntary movements (extrapyramidal dysfunction), and a general decrease in brain function (cognitive deficit). The incidence of 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type III is about 1 in 10,000 newborns in the Iraqi Jewish population. This disorder is extremely rare in all other populations. The signs and symptoms of 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type IV are variable and overlap with types I-III. The incidence of 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type IV is unknown. The inheritance patterns of 3-methylglutaconic aciduria differ depending on the gene involved."}

The new classification is in relation of the type of associated fistula. The classical Wingspread classification was in low and high anomalies: - A low lesion, in which the colon remains close to the skin. In this case, there may be a stenosis (narrowing) of the anus, or the anus may be missing altogether, with the rectum ending in a blind pouch. - A high lesion, in which the colon is higher up in the pelvis and there is a fistula connecting the rectum and the bladder, urethra or the vagina. - A persistent cloaca (from the term cloaca, an analogous orifice in reptiles and amphibians), in which the rectum, vagina and urinary tract are joined into a single channel. Imperforate anus is usually present along with other birth defects\u2014spinal problems, heart problems, tracheoesophageal fistula, esophageal atresia, renal anomalies, and limb anomalies are among the possibilities. Imperforate anus is associated with an increased incidence of some other specific anomalies as well, together being called the VACTERL association: - V \u2013 Vertebral anomalies - A \u2013 Anal atresia - C \u2013 Cardiovascular anomalies - T \u2013 Tracheoesophageal fistula - E \u2013 Esophageal atresia - R \u2013 Renal (kidney) and/or radial anomalies - L \u2013 Limb defects Other entities associated with an imperforate anus are trisomies 18 and 21, the cat-eye syndrome (partial trisomy or tetrasomy of a maternally derived number 22 chromosome), Baller-Gerold syndrome, Currarino syndrome, caudal regression syndrome, FG syndrome, Johanson-Blizzard syndrome, McKusick-Kaufman syndrome, Pallister-Hall syndrome, short rib-polydactyly syndrome type 1, Townes-Brocks syndrome, 13q deletion syndrome, urorectal septum malformation sequence, and the OEIS complex (omphalocele, exstrophy of the cloaca, imperforate anus, spinal defects). When an infant is born with an anorectal malformation, it is usually detected quickly as it is a very obvious defect. Doctors will then determine the type of birth defect the child was born with and whether or not there are any associated malformations. It is important to determine the presence of any associated defects during the newborn period in order to treat them early and avoid further sequelae. There are two main categories of anorectal malformations: those that require a protective colostomy and those that do not. The decision to open a colostomy is usually taken within the first 24 hours of birth. Sonography can be used to determine the type of imperforate anus."}

When a patient does present with symptoms, there are general signs and symptoms a clinician will look for: - Clinical Signs: - Pain on completion of the stork test (placed in hyperextension and rotation) - Excessive lordotic posture - Unilateral tenderness on palpation - Visible on diagnostic imaging (Scottie dog fracture) - Symptoms: - Unilateral low back pain - Pain that radiates into the buttocks or legs - Onset of pain can be acute or gradual - Pain that can restricts daily activities - Pain that worsens after strenuous activity - Pain aggravated with lumbar hyperextension The cause of spondylolysis remains unknown, however many factors are thought to contribute to its development. The condition is present in up to 6% of the population, majority of which usually present asymptomatically. Research supports that there are hereditary and acquired risk factors that can make one more susceptible to the defect. The disorder is generally more prevalent in males compared to females, and tends to occur earlier in males due to their involvement in more strenuous activities at a younger age. In a young athlete, the spine is still growing which means there are many ossification centers, leaving points of weakness in the spine. This leaves young athletes at increased risk, particularly when involved in repetitive hyperextension and rotation across the lumbar spine. Spondylolysis is a common cause of low back pain in preadolescents and adolescent athletes, as it accounts for about 50% of all low back pain. It is believed that both repetitive trauma and an inherent genetic weakness can make an individual more susceptible to spondylolysis. Sports involving repetitive or forceful hyperextension of the spine, especially when combined with rotation are the main mechanism of injury for spondylolysis. The stress fracture of the pars interarticularis occurs on the side opposite to activity. For instance, for a right-handed player, the fracture occurs on the left side of the vertebrae. Spondylolysis has a higher occurrence in the following activities: - Baseball - Tennis - Diving - Cheerleading - Gymnastics - Football - Soccer - Wrestling - Weightlifting - Roller Derby - Cricket - Pole Vault - Rugby - Volleyball - Gym - Ultimate Frisbee (especially during impact from laying out) Although this condition can be caused by repetitive trauma to the lumbar spine in strenuous sports, other risk factors can also predispose individuals to spondylolsis. Males are more commonly affected by spondylolysis than females."}

Clinical results may vary from mild diarrhea to a life-threatening sequence of severe abdominal pain, vomiting, bloody stool, ulceration of the small intestine with leakage (perforation) into the peritoneal cavity and possible death within a single day due to peritonitis. Many patients exhibit meteorism. Treatment involves suppressing the toxin-producing organisms with antibiotics such as penicillin G or metronidazole. About half of seriously ill patients require surgery for perforation, persistent intestinal obstruction, or failure to respond to the antibiotics. An investigational toxoid vaccine has been used successfully in some developing countries but is not available outside of research. All the factors collectively causing CNE are generally only present in the hinterlands of New Guinea and parts of Africa, Latin America, and Asia. These factors include protein deprivation (causing inadequate synthesis of trypsin protease (an enzyme), to which the toxin is very sensitive), poor food hygiene, episodic meat feasting, staple diets containing trypsin inhibitors (sweet potatoes), and infection by Ascaris parasites which secrete a trypsin inhibitor. In New Guinea (origin of the term \"pigbel\"), the disease is usually spread through contaminated meat (especially pork) and perhaps by peanuts.

With milder levels of mania, known as hypomania, individuals are energetic, excitable, and may be highly productive. As hypomania worsens, individuals begin to exhibit erratic and impulsive behavior, often making poor decisions due to unrealistic ideas about the future, and sleep less. At the extreme, manic individuals can experience distorted or delusional beliefs about the universe, hallucinate, hear voices, to the point of psychosis. A depressive episode commonly follows an episode of mania. The biological mechanisms responsible for switching from a manic or hypomanic episode to a depressive episode, or vice versa, remain poorly understood. Mania is a distinct period of at least one week of elevated or irritable mood, which can range from euphoria to delirium, and those experiencing hypo- or mania may exhibit three or more of the following behaviors: speak in a rapid, uninterruptible manner, short attention span, racing thoughts, increased goal-oriented activities, agitation, or they may exhibit behaviors characterized as impulsive or high-risk, such as hypersexuality or excessive spending. To meet the definition for a manic episode, these behaviors must impair the individual's ability to socialize or work. If untreated, a manic episode usually lasts three to six months. People with hypomania or mania may experience a decreased need of sleep, impaired judgment, and speak excessively and very rapidly. Manic individuals often have a history of substance abuse developed over years as a form of \"self-medication\". At the more extreme, a person in a full blown manic state can experience psychosis; a break with reality, a state in which thinking is affected along with mood. They may feel unstoppable, or as if they have been \"chosen\" and are on a \"special mission\", or have other grandiose or delusional ideas.

Additional reported risk factors for placenta accreta include maternal age and multiparity, other prior uterine surgery, prior uterine curettage, uterine irradiation, endometrial ablation, Asherman syndrome, uterine leiomyomata, uterine anomalies, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and smoking. The condition is increased in incidence by the presence of scar tissue i. e. Asherman's syndrome usually from past uterine surgery, especially from a past dilation and curettage, (which is used for many indications including miscarriage, termination, and postpartum hemorrhage), myomectomy, or caesarean section. A thin decidua can also be a contributing factor to such trophoblastic invasion. Some studies suggest that the rate of incidence is higher when the fetus is female. Other risk factors include low-lying placenta, anterior placenta, congenital or acquired uterine defects (such as uterine septa), leiomyoma, ectopic implantation of placenta (including cornual pregnancy). Pregnant women above 35 years of age who have had a Caesarian section and now have a placenta previa overlying the uterine scar have a 40% chance of placenta accreta. The placenta forms an abnormally firm and deep attachment to the uterine wall. There is absence of the decidua basalis and incomplete development of the Nitabuch's layer. There are three forms of placenta accreta, distinguishable by the depth of penetration. When the antepartum diagnosis of placenta accreta is made, it is usually based on ultrasound findings in the second or third trimester."}
{"input": "Children with Liddle syndrome are frequently asymptomatic.", "language": "en", "domain": "disease", "full_context": "Children with Liddle syndrome are frequently asymptomatic. The first indication of the syndrome often is the incidental finding of hypertension during a routine physical exam. Because this syndrome is rare, it may only be considered by the treating physician after the child's hypertension does not respond to medications for lowering blood pressure. Adults could present with nonspecific symptoms of low blood potassium, which can include weakness, fatigue, palpitations or muscular weakness (shortness of breath, constipation/abdominal distention or exercise intolerance). Additionally, long-standing hypertension could become symptomatic. This syndrome is caused by dysregulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) due to a genetic mutation at the 16p13-p12 locus. These channels are found on the surface of epithelial cells found in the kidneys, lungs, and sweat glands. The ENaC channel transports sodium into cells. The mutation changes a domain in the channel so it is no longer degraded correctly by the ubiquitin proteasome system. Specifically, the PY motif in the protein is deleted or altered so the E3 ligase (Nedd4) no longer recognizes the channel. This loss of ability to be degraded leads to high amounts of the channel being chronically present in the collecting duct. This results in a hyperaldosteronism-like state, since aldosterone is typically responsible for creating and inserting these channels. The increased sodium resorption leads to increased resorption of water, and hypertension due to an increase in extracellular volume. Evaluation of a child with persistent high blood pressure usually involves analysis of blood electrolytes and an aldosterone level, as well as other tests."}

People with lipodermatosclerosis have tapering of their legs above the ankles, forming a constricting band resembling an inverted champagne bottle. In addition, there may be brownish-red pigmentation and induration. The exact cause of lipodermatosclerosis is unknown. Venous disease, such as venous incompetence, venous hypertension, and body mass (obesity) may be relevant to the underlying pathogenesis. Increased blood pressure in the veins (venous hypertension) can cause diffusion of substances, including fibrin, out of capillaries. Fibrotic tissue may predispose the tissue to ulceration. Recurrent ulceration and fat necrosis is associated with lipodermatosclerosis. In advanced lipodermatosclerosis the proximal leg swells from chronic venous obstruction and the lower leg shrinks from chronic ulceration and fat necrosis resulting in the inverted coke bottle appearance of the lower leg. Lipodermatosclerosis is most commonly diagnosed in middle-aged women. The origin of lipodermatosclerosis is probably multifactorial, involving tissue hypoxia, leakage of proteins into the interstitium, and leukocyte activation. Studies of patients with lipodermatosclerosis have demonstrated significantly decreased concentrations of cutaneous oxygen associated with decreased capillary density. Capillaries are virtually absent in areas of fibrotic scars, leading to a condition known as atrophie blanche or livedoid vasculopathy. Diagnosis is clinical, based on observation."}

Often a person who has experienced depersonalization claims that things seem unreal or hazy. Also, a recognition of a self breaks down (hence the name). Depersonalization can result in very high anxiety levels, which further increase these perceptions. Depersonalization is a subjective experience of unreality in one's self, while derealization is unreality of the outside world. Although most authors currently regard depersonalization (self) and derealization (surroundings) as independent constructs, many do not want to separate derealization from depersonalization. Depersonalization is the third most common psychological symptom, after feelings of anxiety and feelings of depression. Depersonalization is a symptom of anxiety disorders, such as panic disorder. It can also accompany sleep deprivation (often occurring when suffering from jet lag), migraine, epilepsy (especially temporal lobe epilepsy), obsessive-compulsive disorder, stress, anxiety, and some cases of low latent inhibition. Interoceptive exposure is a non-pharmacological method that can be used to induce depersonalization. A similar and overlapping concept called ipseity disturbance (ipse is Latin for \"self\" or \"itself\") may be part of the core process of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. However, specific to the schizophrenia spectrum seems to be \"a dislocation of first-person perspective such that self and other or self and world may seem to be non-distinguishable, or in which the individual self or field of consciousness takes on an inordinate significance in relation to the objective or intersubjective world\" (emphasis in original).

No treatment is indicated for essential fructosuria, while the degree of fructosuria depends on the dietary fructose intake, it does not have any clinical manifestations. The amount of fructose routinely lost in urine is quite small. Other errors in fructose metabolism have greater clinical significance. Hereditary fructose intolerance, or the presence of fructose in the blood (fructosemia), is caused by a deficiency of aldolase B, the second enzyme involved in the metabolism of fructose. This enzyme deficiency results in an accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate, which inhibits the production of glucose and results in diminished regeneration of adenosine triphosphate. Clinically, patients with hereditary fructose intolerance are much more severely affected than those with essential fructosuria, with elevated uric acid, growth abnormalities and can result in coma if untreated."}

For example, deficiencies of iron, vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B3 (niacin), vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), vitamin B9 (folic acid) or vitamin B12 (cobalamine) may all manifest as stomatitis. Iron is necessary for the upregulation of transcriptional elements for cell replication and repair. Lack of iron can cause genetic downregulation of these elements, leading to ineffective repair and regeneration of epithelial cells, especially in the mouth and lips. Many disorders which cause malabsorption can cause deficiencies, which in turn causes stomatitis. Examples include tropical sprue. Aphthous stomatitis (canker sores) is the recurrent appearance of mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals. The cause is not completely understood, but it is thought that the condition represents a T cell mediated immune response which is triggered by a variety of factors. The individual ulcers (aphthae) recur periodically and heal completely, although in the more severe forms new ulcers may appear in other parts of the mouth before the old ones have finished healing. Aphthous stomatitis is one of the most common diseases of the oral mucosa, and is thought to affect about 20% of the general population to some degree. The symptoms range from a minor nuisance to being disabling in their impact on eating, swallowing and talking, and the severe forms can cause people to lose weight. There is no cure for aphthous stomatitis, and therapies are aimed at alleviating the pain, reducing the inflammation and promoting healing of the ulcers, but there is little evidence of efficacy for any treatment that has been used. Inflammation of the corners (angles) of the lips is termed angular stomatitis or angular cheilitis. In children a frequent cause is repeated lip-licking, and in adults it may be a sign of underlying iron deficiency anemia, or vitamin B deficiencies (e."}

According to Science Daily, \"Gravity plays a major role in our spatial orientation. Changes in gravitational forces, such as the transition to weightlessness during a space voyage, influence our spatial orientation and require adaptation by many of the physiological processes in which our balance system plays a part. As long as this adaptation is incomplete, this can be coupled to motion sickness (nausea), visual illusions and disorientation. \" Modern motion-sickness medications can counter space sickness but are rarely used because it is considered better to allow space travelers to adapt naturally over the first day or two than to suffer the drowsiness and other side effects of medication. However, transdermal dimenhydrinate anti-nausea patches are typically used whenever space suits are worn because vomiting into a space suit could be fatal, as it could obscure vision or block airflow. Space suits are generally worn during launch and landing by NASA crew members and always for extra-vehicular activities (EVAs). EVAs are consequently not usually scheduled for the first days of a mission to allow the crew to adapt, and transdermal dimenhydrinate patches are typically used as an additional backup measure. Space motion sickness was effectively unknown during the earliest spaceflights as these were undertaken in very cramped conditions; it seems to be aggravated by being able to freely move around and so is more common in larger spacecraft. After the Apollo 8 and Apollo 9 flights, where astronauts reported space motion sickness to Mission Control and then were subsequently removed from the flight list, astronauts (e. g. the Skylab 4 crew) attempted to prevent Mission Control from learning about their own SAS experience, apparently out of concern for their future flight assignment potential. As with sea sickness and car sickness, space motion sickness symptoms can vary from mild nausea and disorientation, to vomiting and intense discomfort; headaches and nausea are often reported in varying degrees. About half of sufferers experience mild symptoms; only around 10% suffer severely."}

The two main types of human skin are glabrous skin, the nonhairy skin on the palms and soles (also referred to as the \"palmoplantar\" surfaces), and hair-bearing skin. Within the latter type, hairs in structures called pilosebaceous units have a hair follicle, sebaceous gland, and associated arrector pili muscle. In the embryo, the epidermis, hair, and glands are from the ectoderm, which is chemically influenced by the underlying mesoderm that forms the dermis and subcutaneous tissues. The epidermis is the most superficial layer of skin, a squamous epithelium with several strata: the stratum corneum, stratum lucidum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum basale. Nourishment is provided to these layers via diffusion from the dermis, since the epidermis is without direct blood supply. The epidermis contains four cell types: keratinocytes, melanocytes, Langerhans cells, and Merkel cells. Of these, keratinocytes are the major component, constituting roughly 95% of the epidermis. This stratified squamous epithelium is maintained by cell division within the stratum basale, in which differentiating cells slowly displace outwards through the stratum spinosum to the stratum corneum, where cells are continually shed from the surface. In normal skin, the rate of production equals the rate of loss; about two weeks are needed for a cell to migrate from the basal cell layer to the top of the granular cell layer, and an additional two weeks to cross the stratum corneum. The dermis is the layer of skin between the epidermis and subcutaneous tissue, and comprises two sections, the papillary dermis and the reticular dermis. The superficial papillary dermis interdigitates with the overlying rete ridges of the epidermis, between which the two layers interact through the basement membrane zone. Structural components of the dermis are collagen, elastic fibers, and ground substance also called extra fibrillar matrix. Within these components are the pilosebaceous units, arrector pili muscles, and the eccrine and apocrine glands."}

It is treated by Arthroplasty, the replacement of the joint by a synthetic joint made of titanium and teflon. Chondroitin sulfate, a monomer of the polysaccharide portion of proteoglycan, has been shown to reduce the symptoms of osteoarthritis, possibly by increasing the synthesis of the extracellular matrix. - Achondroplasia: Reduced proliferation of chondrocytes in the epiphyseal plate of long bones during infancy and childhood, resulting in dwarfism. - Costochondritis: Inflammation of cartilage in the ribs, causing chest pain. - Spinal disc herniation: Asymmetrical compression of an intervertebral disc ruptures the sac-like disc, causing a herniation of its soft content. The hernia compresses the adjacent nerves and causes back pain. - Relapsing polychondritis: a destruction, probably autoimmune, of cartilage, especially of the nose and ears, causing disfiguration. Death occurs by suffocation as the larynx loses its rigidity and collapses. - Cartilage tumors Though articular cartilage damage is not life-threatening, it does strongly affect the quality of life. Articular cartilage damage is often the cause of severe pain, swellings, strong barriers to mobility and severe restrictions to the patient's activities.

Shambare, Rugimbana & Zhowa (2012) claimed that cell phones are \"possibly the biggest non-drug addiction of the 21st century\", and that colleges students may spend up to nine hours every day on their phones, which can lead to dependence on such technologies as a driver of modern life and an example of \"a paradox of technology\". that is both freeing and enslaving. A survey conducted by SecurEnvoy showed that young adults and adolescents are more likely to suffer from nomophobia. The same survey reported that 77% of the teens reported anxiety and worries when they were without their mobile phones, followed by the 25-34 age group and people over 55 years old. Some psychological predictors to look for in a person who might be suffering of this phobia are \"self negative views, younger age, low esteem and self-efficacy, high extroversion or introversion, impulsiveness and sense of urgency and sensation seeking\". Among students, frequent cell phone usage has been correlated with decreases in grade point average (GPA) and increased anxiety that negatively impacts self-reported life satisfaction (well-being and happiness) in comparison to students with less frequent usage. GPA decreases may be due to the over-use of cell phone or computer usage consuming time and focus during studying, attending class, working on assignments, and the distraction of cell phones during class. Over-usage of cell phones may increase anxiety due to the pressure to be continually connected to social networks and could rob chances of perceived solitude, relieving daily stress, that has been linked as a component of well-being. In Australia 946 adolescents and emerging adults between ages 15 and 24 participated in a mobile phone research study (387 males, 557 females, and two chose not to report a gender).

Later in the disease process, there is painless increasing loss of range of motion of the affected fingers. The earliest sign of a contracture is a triangular \u201cpuckering\u201d of the skin of the palm as it passes over the flexor tendon just before the flexor crease of the finger, at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. Generally, the cords or contractures are painless, but, rarely, tenosynovitis can occur and produce pain. The most common finger to be affected is the ring finger; the thumb and index finger are much less often affected. The disease begins in the palm and moves towards the fingers, with the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints affected before the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints. In Dupuytren's contracture, the palmar fascia within the hand becomes abnormally thick, which can cause the fingers to curl and can impair finger function. The main function of the palmar fascia is to increase grip strength; thus, over time, Dupuytren's contracture decreases a person's ability to hold objects. People may report pain, aching and itching with the contractions. Normally, the palmar fascia consists of collagen type I, but in Dupuytren sufferers, the collagen changes to collagen type III, which is significantly thicker than collagen type I. People with severe involvement often show lumps on the back of their finger joints (called \u201cGarrod's pads\u201d, \u201cknuckle pads\u201d, or \u201cdorsal Dupuytren nodules\u201d) and lumps in the arch of the feet (plantar fibromatosis or Ledderhose disease).

Commonly used low molecular weight heparins are enoxaparin, dalteparin, nadroparin and tinzaparin. In HIT, the platelet count in the blood falls below the normal range, a condition called thrombocytopenia. However, it is generally not low enough to lead to an increased risk of bleeding. Most people with HIT will therefore not experience any symptoms. Typically the platelet count will fall 5\u201314 days after heparin is first given; if someone has received heparin in the previous three months, the fall in platelet count may occur sooner, sometimes within a day. The most common symptom of HIT is enlargement or extension of a previously diagnosed blood clot, or the development of a new blood clot elsewhere in the body. This may take the form of clots either in arteries or veins, causing arterial or venous thrombosis, respectively. Examples of arterial thrombosis are stroke, myocardial infarction (\"heart attack\"), and acute leg ischemia. Venous thrombosis may occur in the leg or arm in the form of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and in the lung in the form of a pulmonary embolism (PE); the latter usually originate in the leg but migrate to the lung.

Due in part to elevated LH levels, which stimulate androgen production by theca cells in the ovaries, and due in part to FSH insensitivity, resulting in a lack of aromatase in nearby granulosa cells that normally convert androgens into estrogens, it could be expected that females with FSH insensitivity might present with symptoms of hyperandrogenism at puberty. However, this has not been found to be the case. This may be in part because FSH, via stimulation of granulosa cells and the resultant secretion of yet-unidentified paracrine factors (but possibly including inhibin B), has been shown to significantly enhance the LH-mediated stimulation of androgen production by theca cells. In addition, theca cells predominantly secrete the relatively weak androgen androstenedione, whereas granulosa cells, signaled to do so by FSH under normal circumstances, convert androstenedione into its more potent relative testosterone (which is subsequently converted into estradiol). Hence, in females, FSH insensitivity may not only result in deficiencies in estrogen production by granulosa cells, but in diminished androgen synthesis by both theca and granulosa cells as well, which could potentially explain why hyperandrogenism does not occur. FSH insensitivity presents itself in females as two clusters of symptoms: 1) hypergonadotropic hypogonadism or hypoestrogenism, resulting in a delayed, reduced, or fully absent puberty and associated sexual infantilism (if left untreated), reduced uterine volume, and osteoporosis; and 2) ovarian dysgenesis or failure, resulting in primary or secondary amenorrhea, infertility, and normal sized to slightly enlarged ovaries. Males on the other hand are significantly less affected, presenting merely with partial or complete infertility, reduced testicular volume, and oligozoospermia (reduced spermatogenesis). FSH insensitivity is caused by inactivating mutations of the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) and thus an insensitivity of the receptor to FSH. This results in an inability of the granulosa cells in ovarian follicles to respond to FSH in females, in turn resulting in diminished estrogen production by the ovaries and loss of menstrual cycles, and an inability of Sertoli cells in the seminiferous tubules of the testicles to respond to FSH in males, which in turn results in impaired spermatogenesis. Hormone replacement therapy with estrogen may be used to treat symptoms of hypoestrogenism in females with the condition. There are currently no known treatments for the infertility caused by the condition in either sex."}

Symptoms may progress rapidly to abdominal discoloration with intestinal perforation and peritonitis and systemic hypotension requiring intensive medical support. The diagnosis is usually suspected clinically but often requires the aid of diagnostic imaging modalities, most commonly radiography. Specific radiographic signs of NEC are associated with specific Bell's stages of the disease: Bell's stage 1/Suspected disease: - Mild systemic disease (apnea, lethargy, bradycardia, temperature instability) - Mild intestinal signs (abdominal distention, increased gastric residuals, bloody stools) - Non-specific or normal radiological signs Bell's stage 2/Definite disease: - Mild to moderate systemic signs - Additional intestinal signs (absent bowel sounds, abdominal tenderness) - Specific radiologic signs (pneumatosis intestinalis or portal venous air) - Laboratory changes (metabolic acidosis, thrombocytopaenia) Bell's stage 3/Advanced disease: - Severe systemic illness (hypotension) - Additional intestinal signs (striking abdominal distention, peritonitis) - Severe radiologic signs (pneumoperitoneum) - Additional laboratory changes (metabolic and respiratory acidosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation) More recently ultrasonography has proven to be useful as it may detect signs and complications of NEC before they are evident on radiographs, specifically in cases that involve a paucity of bowel gas, a gasless abdomen, or a sentinel loop. Diagnosis is ultimately made in 5\u201310% of very low-birth-weight infants (<1,500g). Treatment consists primarily of supportive care including providing bowel rest by stopping enteral feeds, gastric decompression with intermittent suction, fluid repletion to correct electrolyte abnormalities and third-space losses, support for blood pressure, parenteral nutrition, and prompt antibiotic therapy. Monitoring is clinical, although serial supine and left lateral decubitus abdominal x-rays should be performed every six hours. Where the disease is not halted through medical treatment alone, or when the bowel perforates, immediate emergency surgery to resect the dead bowel is generally required, although abdominal drains may be placed in very unstable infants as a temporizing measure.

The escape rhythm typically originates in the AV junction, producing a narrow complex escape rhythm. An anterior wall myocardial infarction may damage the distal conduction system of the heart, causing third-degree heart block. This is typically extensive, permanent damage to the conduction system, necessitating a permanent pacemaker to be placed. The escape rhythm typically originates in the ventricles, producing a wide complex escape rhythm. Third-degree heart block may also be congenital and has been linked to the presence of lupus in the mother. It is thought that maternal antibodies may cross the placenta and attack the heart tissue during gestation. The cause of congenital third-degree heart block in many patients is unknown."}

On exam patients have normal to decreased visual acuity, and a \u201cbeaten metal appearance\u201d of the corneal endothelium, corneal edema, increased intraocular pressure, peripheral anterior synechiae, and iris changes [1,2,6]. The exact mechanism is unknown, however there appears to be a component of abnormal corneal endothelium that proliferates onto the iris forming a membrane that then obstructs the trabecular meshwork, leading to iris distortion [1,2]. Nodule formation can also occur when the abnormal corneal endothelium causes contractions around the iris stroma [1]. Herpesvirus DNA has been identified in some patients following keratoplasty, suggesting the possibility that herpes simplex virus may induce the abnormal endotheliazation in the anterior chamber angle and on the surface of the iris [2,3,5]. The Chandler variant of ICE is characterized by pathology on the inner surface of the cornea leading to abnormal endothelial pump function [2,6]. Other features include possible mild iris changes, corneal edema, and normal to slight elevations in intraocular pressure [1,6]. Cogan-Reese variant is characterized by multiple pigmented iris nodules [2,6]. This variant is most commonly unilateral and seen in middle-aged females [2]. Penetrating karatoplasty and endothelial keratoplasty can be used as treatments for severe cases of ICE [2,8]. Because glaucoma and elevated intraocular pressure are often present in ICE patients, long term follow up may be needed to ensure adequate intraocular pressures are maintained [2,7] The disease is chronic and often progresses slowly. Prognosis is generally poor when associated with glaucoma [1,2]."}

When someone has advanced sleep phase disorder their melatonin levels and core body temperature will cycle hours earlier than an average person. These symptoms must be present for at least three months in order to be correctly diagnosed. ASPD is a rare disorder. It affects both men and women equally and has been determined to have a strong genetic, link with 40\u201350% of sufferers having relatives with the disorder. As stated below, several genes have been discovered to have links with this syndrome and the body's circadian rhythms. Although it can be impairing, the syndrome is not necessarily unhealthy; most people don't seek help unless it starts to severely impact their social life. Once diagnosed, ASPD can be treated with bright light therapy in the evenings or behaviorally with chronotherapy. Unlike other sleep disorders, ASPD does not disrupt normal functioning at work during the day and the patient does not complain of excessive daytime sleepiness. If their ASPD is causing people to lose out on evening activities, including putting their own typical children to bed, they may be able to force themselves to stay up later than their circadian rhythm requires. A sufferer of ASPD will still wake up very early and if this cycle continues it can lead to chronic sleep deprivation and other sleep disorders. In 1999, Louis Pt\u00e1\u010dek's and Ying-Hui Fu's research group at the University of California, San Francisco reported findings of a human circadian rhythm disorder showing a familial tendency.

Most of these individuals showed either a deletion or an insertion resulting in a frameshift mutation. Type II and III patients showed small scale changes in the overall structure of D-BP[6]. Amino acid changes in the catalytic domains or those in contact with substrate or cofactors were the main cause of these variations of D-BP deficiency. Other amino acid changes were seen to alter the dimerization of the protein, leading to improper folding. Many mutations have been found in the gene coding for D-BP(HSD17B4)on the q arm two of chromosome five (5q2) in Homo sapiens, most notably individuals homozygous for a missense mutation (616S). The D-bifunctional protein is composed of three enzymatic domains: the N-terminal short chain alcohol dehydrogenase reductase (SDR), central hydratase domain, and the C-terminal sterol carrier protein 2 (SDR). The DBP protein (79kDa) also known as \u201cmultifunctional protein 2\u201d, \u201cmultifunctional enzyme 2\u201d, or \u201cD-peroxisomal bifunctional enzyme\u201d, catalyzes the second and third steps of peroxisomal \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids and their derivatives. A non-functional D-BP protein results in the abnormal accumulation of long chain fatty acids and bile acid intermediates. The D-BP protein contains a peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1) unit at the C-terminus allowing for its transport into peroxisomes by the PTS1 receptor. Inside the peroxisomes, the D-BP protein is partially cleaved exclusively between the SDR and hydratase domains. DBP is a stereospecific enzyme; hydratase domain forms only (R)-hydroxy-acyl-CoA intermediates from trans-2-enoyl-CoAs. D-BP is expressed throughout the entire human body, with the highest mRNA levels in the liver and brain. The hydrogenase and hydratase units of DBP exist as dimers, necessary for correct folding and therefore function of the enzyme."}

Sexual desire disorders or decreased libido are characterized by a lack or absence for some period of time of sexual desire or libido for sexual activity or of sexual fantasies. The condition ranges from a general lack of sexual desire to a lack of sexual desire for the current partner. The condition may have started after a period of normal sexual functioning or the person may always have had no/low sexual desire. The causes vary considerably, but include a possible decrease in the production of normal estrogen in women or testosterone in both men and women. Other causes may be aging, fatigue, pregnancy, medications (such as the SSRIs) or psychiatric conditions, such as depression and anxiety. While a number of causes for low sexual desire are often cited, only some of these have ever been the object of empirical research. Sexual arousal disorders were previously known as frigidity in women and impotence in men, though these have now been replaced with less judgmental terms. Impotence is now known as erectile dysfunction, and frigidity has been replaced with a number of terms describing specific problems that can be broken down into four categories as described by the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: lack of desire, lack of arousal, pain during intercourse, and lack of orgasm. For both men and women, these conditions can manifest themselves as an aversion to, and avoidance of, sexual contact with a partner. In men, there may be partial or complete failure to attain or maintain an erection, or a lack of sexual excitement and pleasure in sexual activity. There may be physiological origins to these disorders, such as decreased blood flow or lack of vaginal lubrication. Chronic disease can also contribute, as well as the nature of the relationship between the partners.

Examples include: - Vascular causes: bilateral hemisphere infarction, CADASIL syndrome - Progressive supranuclear palsy - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - Parkinson's disease and related multiple system atrophy - Various motor neuron diseases, especially those involving demyelination - Multiple sclerosis and other inflammatory disorders - High brain stem tumors - Metabolic causes: osmotic demyelination syndrome - Neurological involvement in Beh\u00e7et's disease - Brain trauma The proposed mechanism of pseudobulbar palsy points to the disinhibition of the motor neurons controlling laughter and crying, proposing that a reciprocal pathway exists between the cerebellum and the brain stem that adjusts laughter and crying responses, making them appropriate to context. The pseudobulbar crying could also be induced by stimulation in the region of the subthalamic nucleus of the brain. Signs and symptoms of pseudobulbar palsy include: - Slow and indistinct speech - Dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing) - Small, stiff and spastic tongue - Brisk jaw jerk - Dysarthria - Labile affect - Gag reflex may be normal, exaggerated or absent - Examination may reveal upper motor neuron lesion of the limbs Diagnosis of pseudobulbar palsy is based on observation of the symptoms of the condition. Tests examining jaw jerk and gag reflex can also be performed. It has been suggested that the majority of patients with pathological laughter and crying have pseudobulbar palsy due to bilateral corticobulbar lesions and often a bipyrimidal involvement of arms and legs. To further confirm the condition, MRI can be performed to define the areas of brain abnormality. Since pseudobulbar palsy is a syndrome associated with other diseases, treating the underlying disease may eventually reduce the symptoms of pseudobulbar palsy. Possible pharmacological interventions for pseudobulbar affect include the tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and a novel approach utilizing dextromethorphan and quinidine sulfate. Nuedexta is an FDA approved medication for pseudobulbar affect. Dextromethorphan, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, inhibits glutamatergic transmission in the regions of the brainstem and cerebellum, which are hypothesized to be involved in pseudobulbar symptoms, and acts as a sigma ligand, binding to the sigma-1 receptors that mediate the emotional motor expression."}

In 1989, Bruce McIntosh coined the term the \"spoiled child syndrome\". The syndrome is characterized by \"excessive, self-centered, and immature behavior\". It includes lack of consideration for other people, recurrent temper tantrums, an inability to handle the delay of gratification, demands for having one's own way, obstructiveness, and manipulation to get their way. McIntosh attributed the syndrome to \"the failure of parents to enforce consistent, age-appropriate limits\", but others, such as Aylward, note that temperament is probably a contributory factor. It is important to note that the temper tantrums are recurrent. McIntosh observes that \"many of the problem behaviors that cause parental concern are unrelated to spoiling as properly understood\". Children may have occasional temper tantrums without them falling under the umbrella of \"spoiled\". Extreme cases of spoiled child syndrome, in contrast, will involve frequent temper tantrums, physical aggression, defiance, destructive behavior, and refusal to comply with even the simple demands of daily tasks. This can be similar to the profile of children diagnosed with Pathological Demand Avoidance, which is part of the autism spectrum. Children with underlying medical or mental health problems may exhibit some of the symptoms. Indeed, where the difficulties are not predicated in the parental-child nexus, many loving parents may be judged as \"spoiling\" instead of affirmed. Speech or hearing disorders, and attention deficit disorder, may lead to children's failing to understand the limits set by parents. Children who have recently experienced a stressful event, such as the separation of the parents (divorce) or the birth or death of a close family relative, may also exhibit some or all of the symptoms."}

Prolapse was also known. The theory of a wandering uterus was developed in Ancient Greece, being mentioned in many sections of the Hippocratic treatise \"Diseases of Women\". Plato talks of the uterus as a separate being inside women, while Aretaeus described it as \"an animal within an animal\" (less emotively, \"a living thing inside a living thing\"), which causes symptoms by wandering around a woman's body putting pressure on other organs. The standard cure for this \"hysterical suffocation\" was scent therapy, in which good smells were placed under a woman's genitals and bad odors at the nose, while sneezing could be also induced to drive the uterus back to its correct place. While in the Hippocratic texts a wide range of women were susceptible - including in particular the childless - Galen in the 2nd century omitted the childless and saw the most vulnerable group as \"widows, and particularly those who previously menstruated regularly, had been pregnant and were eager to have intercourse, but were now deprived of all this\" (On the Affected Parts, 6. 5). He also denied that the womb could \"move from one place to another like a wandering animal\". His treatments included scent therapy and sexual intercourse, but also rubbing in ointments to the external genitalia; this was to be performed by midwives, not physicians. While most Hippocratic writers saw the retention of menstrual blood in the womb as a key problem, for Galen even more serious was the retention of \"female seed\". In Medieval times, this idea of the \u201cwandering uterus\u201d persisted, as did the methods of treatment. There was also the idea that there was a build up of humours, or fluid in the uterus that needed to be purged in order to cure the female patient of the disease. Self-treatment such as masturbation, was not recommended and also considered taboo. Marriage, and therefore regular sexual intercourse was considered the best long-term treatment option."}

Ectrodactyly, or Split hand/split foot malformation (SHFM) type 1 is the only form of split hand/ malformation associated with sensorineural hearing loss. A large number of human gene defects can cause ectrodactyly. The most common mode of inheritance is autosomal dominant with reduced penetrance, while autosomal recessive and X-linked forms occur more rarely. Ectrodactyly can also be caused by a duplication on 10q24. Detailed studies of a number of mouse models for ectrodactyly have also revealed that a failure to maintain median apical ectodermal ridge (AER) signalling can be the main pathogenic mechanism in triggering this abnormality. A number of factors make the identification of the genetic defects underlying human ectrodactyly a complicated process: the limited number of families linked to each split hand/foot malformation (SHFM) locus, the large number of morphogens involved in limb development, the complex interactions between these morphogens, the involvement of modifier genes, and the presumed involvement of multiple gene or long-range regulatory elements in some cases of ectrodactyly. In the clinical setting these genetic characteristics can become problematic and making predictions of carrier status and severity of the disease impossible to predict. In 2011, a novel mutation in DLX5 was found to be involved in SHFM. Ectrodactyly is frequently seen with other congenital anomalies. Syndromes in which ectrodactyly is associated with other abnormalities can occur when two or more genes are affected by a chromosomal rearrangement.

Additionally, the WHO scheme recognizes mixed tumors with both neuroendocrine and epithelial carcinoma features, such as goblet cell cancer, a rare gastrointestinal tract tumor. Placing a given tumor into one of categories depends on well-defined histological features: size, lymphovascular invasion, mitotic counts, Ki-67 labelling index, invasion of adjacent organs, presence of metastases and whether they produce hormones. Traditionally, neuroendocrine tumors have been classified by their anatomic site of origin. NETs can arise in many different areas of the body, and are most often located in the intestine, pancreas or the lungs. The various kinds of cells that can give rise to NETs are present in endocrine glands and are also diffusely distributed throughout the body, most commonly Kulchitsky cells or similar enterochromaffin-like cells, that are relatively more common in the gastrointestinal and pulmonary systems. NETs include certain tumors of the gastrointestinal tract and of the pancreatic islet cells, certain thymus and lung tumors, and medullary carcinoma of the parafollicular cells of the thyroid. Tumors with similar cellular characteristics in the pituitary, parathyroid, and adrenomedullary glands are sometimes included or excluded. Within the broad category of neuroendocrine tumors there are many different tumor types: this outline is presented to facilitate retrieving information. Neuroendocrine tumors are uncommon in many of these areas, and frequently represent only a very small proportion of the tumors or cancers at these locations. - Pituitary gland: Neuroendocrine tumor of the anterior pituitary - Thyroid gland: Neuroendocrine thyroid tumors, particularly medullary carcinoma - Parathyroid tumors - Thymus and mediastinal carcinoid tumors - Pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors - bronchus - pulmonary carcinoid tumors: typical carcinoid (TC; low-grade); atypical carcinoid (AC; intermediate-grade) - small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) - large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung (LCNEC) - Extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas (ESCC or EPSCC) - Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NET) - Foregut GEP-NET (foregut tumors can conceptually encompasses not only NETs of the stomach and proximal duodenum, but also the pancreas, and even thymus, lung and bronchus) - Pancreatic endocrine tumors (if considered separately from foregut GEP-NET) - Midgut GEP-NET (from distal half of 2nd part of the duodenum to the proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon) - appendix, including well differentiated NETs (benign); well differentiated NETs (uncertain malignant potential); well differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma (with low malignant potential); mixed exocrine-neuroendocrine carcinoma (goblet cell carcinoma, also called adenocarcinoid and mucous adenocarcinoid) - Hindgut GEP-NET - Liver and gallbladder - Adrenal tumors, particularly adrenomedullary tumors - Pheochromocytoma - Peripheral nervous system tumors, such as: - Schwannoma - paraganglioma - neuroblastoma - Breast - Genitourinary tract - urinary tract carcinoid tumor and neuroendocrine carcinoma - ovary - neuroendocrine tumor of the cervix - testes - Merkel cell carcinoma of skin (trabecular cancer) - Several inherited conditions: - multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) - multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) - von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease - neurofibromatosis type 1 - tuberous sclerosis - Carney complex Neuroendocrine lesions are graded histologically according to markers of cellular proliferation, rather than cellular polymorphism. The following grading scheme is currently recommended for all gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms by the World Health Organisation: If mitotic count and ki67 are discordant, the figure which gives the highest grade is used.

This is caused by increased bloodflow to the vagina due to increased estrogen. Female infants may have leukorrhea for a short time after birth due to their in-uterine exposure to estrogen. It may also result from inflammation or congestion of the vaginal mucosa. In cases where it is yellowish or gives off an odor, a doctor should be consulted since it could be a sign of several disease processes, including an organic bacterial infection (aerobic vaginitis) or STD. After delivery, leukorrhea accompanied by backache and foul-smelling lochia (post-partum vaginal discharge, containing blood, mucus, and placental tissue) may suggest the failure of involution (the uterus returning to pre-pregnancy size) due to infection. A number of investigation such as wet smear, Gram stain, culture, pap smear and biopsy are suggested to diagnose the condition. Leukorrhea is also caused by trichomonads, a group of parasitic protozoan, specifically Trichomonas vaginalis. Common symptoms of this disease are burning sensation, itching and discharge of frothy substance, thick, white or yellow mucous.

After 150 years of contact, no resistance has been discovered in native European crayfish. This species was studied and named by the German Mycologist, Friedrich Schikora (1859\u20131932), from a type specimen in Germany in 1906. Implantations of the signal crayfish were the reason for the spread of the disease to United Kingdom and Ireland. Transport of signal crayfish, red swamp crayfish and infected native European freshwater crayfish between waters is the main cause for contamination. Transmission of the disease through items that has been in contact with contaminated water, for example a fishing tool or footwear is also possible. The spores are also sensitive to high or low temperatures. Most authorities have local rules and regulations that the amount of water moved between different waters (in for example a boat) is minimised. It is usually also recommended to only use fishing bait from the same lake when fishing, alternatively freeze it to at least for one day before use, if risk for contamination exists. The spores of crayfish plague disappear from an infected water system (connected lakes and rivers) in a few weeks after the last infected crayfish is gone. Reintroduction is then possible, as long as no infected waters are in contact with the lake."}

The prevalence of cryptococcosis has been increasing over the past 20 years for many reasons, including the increase in incidence of AIDS and the expanded use of immunosuppressive drugs. In humans, C. neoformans causes three types of infections: - Wound or cutaneous cryptococcosis - Pulmonary cryptococcosis - Cryptococcal meningitis. Cryptococcal meningitis (infection of the meninges, the tissue covering the brain) is believed to result from dissemination of the fungus from either an observed or unappreciated pulmonary infection. Often there is also silent dissemination throughout the brain when meningitis is present. Cryptococcus gattii causes infections in immunocompetent people (fully functioning immune system), but C. neoformans v. grubii, and v. neoformans usually only cause clinically evident infections in persons with some form of defect in their immune systems (immunocompromised persons)."}

Other terms used to describe the condition in dogs include cerebellar cortical atrophy and postnatal cerebellar cortical degeneration. Cerebellar abiotrophy in horses was originally thought to be a form of cerebellar hypoplasia and was described as such in older research literature. However, it was discovered that in horses, the die-off of purkinje cells began after the animal was born, rather than occurring in utero. Cerebellar hypoplasia is particularly common in cats and has similar symptoms. There are other diseases that lead to cerebellar degeneration, but the loss of Purkinje cells is a clear way to diagnose CA, and the combination of symptoms is sufficiently unique that CA can easily be distinguished from other conditions, even in a living animal. Symptoms of cerebellar abiotrophy include ataxia or lack of balance, an awkward wide-legged stance, a head tremor (intention tremor) (in dogs, body tremors also occur), hyperreactivity, lack of menace reflex, stiff or high-stepping gait, coarse or jerky head bob when in motion (or in very young animals, when attempting to nurse), apparent lack of awareness of where the feet are (sometimes standing or trying to walk with a foot knuckled over), poor depth perception, and a general inability to determine space and distance. The symptoms, when taken as a group, are distinctive and not easily mimicked by other illnesses, though certain types of neurological injury and infection need to be ruled out. Verifying the diagnosis in a laboratory setting is possible only by examining the brain post-mortem to determine if there has been a loss of Purkinje cells. Most affected animals have normal intelligence and mildly affected animals can, in theory, live out a normal lifespan. However, affected animals are quite accident-prone, and for this reason many animals that develop CA, particularly horses, are euthanized for humane reasons. Horses may experience difficulty stepping up and over objects, run into fences, fall easily, and even if allowed to mature to full growth, are generally considered unsafe to ride. Dogs may need lifetime assistance with tasks such as climbing stairs. In horses, the symptoms may worsen from the time of onset for six to 12 months, but if not severe enough to mandate euthansia, they stabilize over time."}

The most probable explanation for blackwater fever is an autoimmune reaction apparently caused by the interaction of the malaria parasite and the use of quinine. Blackwater fever is caused by heavy parasitization of red blood cells with Plasmodium falciparum. There has been at least one case, however, attributed to Plasmodium vivax. Blackwater fever is a serious complication of malaria, but cerebral malaria has a higher mortality rate. Blackwater fever is much less common today than it was before 1950. It may be that quinine plays a role in triggering the condition, and this drug is no longer commonly used for malaria prophylaxis. Quinine remains important for treatment of malaria.

The patient may also experience added respiratory sounds which in the more severe cases can be identified as stridor but in many cases can be readily mistaken for wheeze. This creates a diagnostic pitfall in which many patients with laryngotracheal stenosis are incorrectly diagnosed as having asthma and are treated for presumed lower airway disease. This increases the likelihood of the patient eventually requiring major open surgery in benign disease and can lead to tracheal cancer presenting too late for curative surgery to be performed. Laryngotracheal stenosis is an umbrella term for a wide and heterogeneous group of very rare conditions. The population incidence of adult post-intubation laryngotracheal stenosis which is the commonest benign sub-type of this condition is approximately 1 in 200,000 adults per year. The main causes of adult laryngotracheal stenosis are: The optimal management of laryngotracheal stenosis is not well defined, depending mainly on the type of the stenosis. General treatment options include 1. Tracheal dilation using rigid bronchoscope 2. Laser surgery and endoluminal stenting 3. Tracheal resection and laryngotracheal reconstructionr Tracheal dilation is used to temporarily enlarge the airway. The effect of dilation typically lasts from a few days to 6 months. Several studies have shown that as a result of mechanical dilation (used alone) may occur a high mortality rate and a rate of recurrence of stenosis higher than 90%. Thus, many authors treat the stenosis by endoscopic excision with laser (commonly either the carbon dioxide or the neodymium: yttrium aluminum garnet laser) and then by using bronchoscopic dilatation and prolonged stenting with a T-tube (generally in silicone)."}

Fecal occult blood testing is positive when bleeding is active. If bleeding is intermittent the test may be negative at times. Histologically, it resembles telangiectasia and development is related to age and strain on the bowel wall. It is a degenerative lesion, acquired, probably resulting from chronic and intermittent contraction of the colon that is obstructing the venous drainage of the mucosa. As time goes by the veins become more and more tortuous, while the capillaries of the mucosa gradually dilate and precapillary sphincter becomes incompetent. Thus is formed an arteriovenous malformation characterized by a small tuft of dilated vessels. Although angiodysplasia is probably quite common, the risk of bleeding is increased in disorders of coagulation. A classic association is Heyde's syndrome (coincidence of aortic valve stenosis and bleeding from angiodysplasia). In this disorder, von Willebrand factor (vWF) is proteolysed due to high shear stress in the highly turbulent blood flow around the aortic valve. vWF is most active in vascular beds with high shear stress, including angiodysplasias, and deficiency of vWF increases the bleeding risk from such lesions. Warkentin et al. argue that apart from aortic valve stenosis, some other conditions that feature high shear stress might also increase the risk of bleeding from angiodysplasia. Diagnosis of angiodysplasia is often accomplished with endoscopy, either colonoscopy or esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)."}

The chest pain may appear similar to cardiac chest pain (angina pectoris), so investigating the possible existence of heart disease is often indicated. Causes of diffuse esophageal spasm are not well understood. It is thought, however, that many cases are caused by uncontrolled brain signals running to nerve endings. Therefore, suppression medication is often the first line therapy such as anti depressants and anti-epileptic medication are prescribed. It has also been reported that very cold or hot beverages can trigger an esophageal spasm. Avoidance therapy benefits some people, but it has not been medically proven. Several radiographic findings are suggestive of DES, such as a \"rosary bead esophagus\" or \"corkscrew\" appearance on barium swallow x-ray, although these findings are not unique to DES. Several drugs are used to treat DES, including nitroglycerin, hyoscine butylbromide, calcium channel blockers, hydralazine, and anti-anxiety medications. Acid suppression therapy, such as proton pump inhibitors, are often the first line therapy. Botulinum toxin, which inhibits acetylcholine release from nerve endings, injected above the lower esophageal sphincter may also be used in the treatment of DES. Small studies have suggested benefit from endoscopic balloon dilation in certain patients, but all of the above have a low percentage of success in treating the condition; whilst the treatments work in some sufferers, it does not work for everyone.

As the urine is more concentrated in the morning, this is when the color is most pronounced. This phenomenon mainly occurs in those who have the primary form of PNH, who will notice this at some point in their disease course. The remainder mainly experience the symptoms of anemia, such as tiredness, shortness of breath, and palpitations. A small proportion of patients report attacks of abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing and pain during swallowing, as well as erectile dysfunction in men; this occurs mainly when the breakdown of red blood cells is rapid, and is attributable to spasm of smooth muscle due to depletion of nitric oxide by red cell breakdown products. Forty percent of people with PNH develop thrombosis (a blood clot) at some point in their illness. This is the main cause of severe complications and death in PNH. These may develop in common sites (deep vein thrombosis of the leg and resultant pulmonary embolism when these clots break off and enter the lungs), but in PNH blood clots may also form in more unusual sites: the hepatic vein (causing Budd-Chiari syndrome), the portal vein of the liver (causing portal vein thrombosis), the superior or inferior mesenteric vein (causing mesenteric ischemia) and veins of the skin. Cerebral venous thrombosis, an uncommon form of stroke, is more common in those with PNH. All cells have proteins attached to their membranes, often serving as a mode of communication or signaling between the cell and the surrounding environment. These signaling proteins are physically attached to the cell membrane in various ways, commonly anchored by glycolipids such as glycosyl phosphatidylinositols (GPI). PNH occurs as a result of a defect in the assembling of these glycolipid-protein structures on the surface of blood cells. The most common defective enzyme in PNH is phosphatidylinositol glycan A (PIGA), one of several enzymes needed to make GPI. The gene that codes for PIGA is located on the X chromosome, which means that only one active copy of the gene for PIGA is present in each cell (initially, females have two copies, but one is silenced through X-inactivation)."}

The incidence decreased after radiation therapy was abondoned. Environmental exposures to radiation such as atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Chernobyl disaster also causes an increase in childhood papillary thyroid cancer at 5 to 20 years after the exposure to radiation. Family history of thyroid cancer syndrome such as familial adenomatous polyposis, Carney complex, Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN-2), Werner syndrome, and Cowden syndrome increases the risk of getting papillary cancer.

It is the most common type, followed by ileal atresia. An inherited form \u2013 familial multiple intestinal atresia \u2013 has also been described. This disorder was first reported in 1971. It is due to a mutation in the gene TTC7A on short arm of chromosome 2 (2p16). It is inherited as an autosomal recessive gene and is usually fatal in infancy. The most common cause of non-duodenal intestinal atresia is a vascular accident in utero that leads to decreased intestinal perfusion and ischemia of the respective segment of bowel. This leads to narrowing, or in the most severe cases, complete obliteration of the intestinal lumen. In the case that the superior mesenteric artery, or another major intestinal artery, is occluded, large segments of bowel can be entirely underdeveloped. Classically, the affected area of bowel assumes a spiral configuration and is described to have an \"apple peel\" like appearance; this is accompanied by lack of a dorsal mesentery. Ileal atresia can also result as a complication of meconium ileus. Intestinal atresias are often discovered before birth: either during a routine sonogram which shows a dilated intestinal segment due to the blockage, or by the development of polyhydramnios (the buildup of too much amniotic fluid in the uterus). These abnormalities are indications that the fetus may have a bowel obstruction which a more detailed ultrasound study can confirm. Some fetuses with bowel obstruction have abnormal chromosomes."}

Glycerol kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of glycerol by ATP, yielding ADP and glycerol-3-phosphate. It is more common in males because they only have one X chromosome, whereas females rarely manifest the disease because they have two X chromosomes. If hyperglycerolemia is caused by a mutation in the glycerol kinase gene then it generally causes an isolated glycerol kinase deficiency, resulting in the inability to synthesize triglycerides and glycerophospholipids. If hyperglycerolemia results from a deletion of the glycerol kinase gene then it often is part of a contiguous gene deletion syndrome with associated Duchenne muscular dystrophy and adrenal hypoplasia congenita. The Human Phenotype Ontology provided the following list of symptoms and signs for hyperglycerolemia: Abnormality of metabolism/homeostasis, Cognitive Deficit, EMG abnormality, Muscular Hypotonia, Myopathy, Neurological speech impairment, Primary adrenal insufficiency, Short stature, Cryptorchidism, EEG abnormality, Lumbar Hyperlordosis, Reduced bone mineral density, Scoliosis, Seizures, Abnormal facial shape, and Adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency is associated with the genetic disease X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita. If the glycerol kinase gene is deleted then the NROB1 gene is also often deleted, which causes X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita. Glycerol and glycerol kinase activity analyses are usually not offered by routine general medical laboratories. To diagnose hyperglycerolemia, blood and urine can be tested for the amounts of glycerol present. There are three clinical forms of GKD: infantile, juvenile, and adult.

Its cause is unknown. It can easily be confused with retinal detachment by the non-expert observer and in difficult cases even the expert may have difficulty differentiating the two. Such differentiation is important since retinal detachment almost always requires treatment while retinoschisis never itself requires treatment and leads to retinal detachment (and hence to visual loss) only occasionally. Unfortunately one still sees cases of uncomplicated retinoschisis treated by laser retinopexy or cryopexy in an attempt to stop its progression towards the macula. Such treatments are not only ineffective but unnecessarily risk complications. There is no documented case in the literature of degenerative retinoschisis itself (as opposed to the occasional situation of retinal detachment complicating retinoschisis) in which the splitting of the retina has progressed through the fovea. There is no clinical utility in differentiating between typical and reticular retinoschisis. Degenerative retinoschisis is not known to be a genetically inherited condition. There is always vision loss in the region of the schisis as the sensory retina is separated from the ganglion layer. But like the loss is in the periphery, it goes unnoticed. It is the very rare schisis that encroaches on the macula where retinopexy is then properly used. It is estimated that this much less common form of retinoschisis affects one in 5,000 to 25,000 individuals, primarily young males.

Some other common symptoms that are experienced by X-SCID patients include failure to thrive, gut problems, skin problems, and muscle hypotonia. In some patients symptoms may not appear for the first six months after birth.

Forms of the disease are Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the US, postpartum thyroiditis, subacute thyroiditis, silent thyroiditis, drug-induced thyroiditis, radiation-induced thyroiditis, acute thyroiditis, and Riedel's thyroiditis. Each different type of this disease has its own causes, clinical features, diagnoses, durations, resolutions, conditions and risks. There are many different signs and symptoms for thyroiditis, none of which are exclusively limited to this disease. Many of the signs imitate symptoms of other diseases, so thyroiditis can sometimes be difficult to diagnose. Common hypothyroid symptoms manifest when thyroid cell damage is slow and chronic, and may include fatigue, weight gain, feeling \"fuzzy headed\", depression, dry skin, and constipation. Other, rarer symptoms include swelling of the legs, vague aches and pains, decreased concentration and so on. When conditions become more severe, depending on the type of thyroiditis, one may start to see puffiness around the eyes, slowing of the heart rate, a drop in body temperature, or even incipient heart failure. On the other hand, if the thyroid cell damage is acute, the thyroid hormone within the gland leaks out into the bloodstream causing symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, which is similar to those of hyperthyroidism. These symptoms include weight loss, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, fast heart rate, and fatigue. Elevated levels of thyroid hormone in the bloodstream cause both conditions, but thyrotoxicosis is the term used with thyroiditis since the thyroid gland is not overactive, as in the case of hyperthyroidism. Thyroiditis is generally caused by an attack on the thyroid, resulting in inflammation and damage to the thyroid cells. This disease is often considered a malfunction of the immune system. Antibodies that attack the thyroid are what causes most types of thyroiditis."}

NBS is caused by a mutation in the NBS1 gene. It is thus not surprising that many of the features are similar to ataxia telangiectasia (AT), and this syndrome is sometimes termed AT-variant 1; in AT, an abnormal ATM protein, the normal correlate of which interacts with the MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 (MRN) complex. NBS is caused by a mutation in the NBS1 gene, located at human chromosome 8q21. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome (chromosome 8 is an autosome), and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder. Two adult siblings, both heterozygous for two particular NBS1 nonsense mutations displayed cellular sensitivity to radiation, chromosome instability and fertility defects, but not the developmental defects that are typically found in other NBS patients. These individuals appear to be primarily defective in homologous recombination, a process that accurately repairs double-strand breaks, both in somatic cells and during meiosis. There is no treatment for NBS, however in those with agammaglobulinemia, intravenous immunoglobulin may be started. Prophylactic antibiotics are considered to prevent urinary tract infections as those with NBS often have congenital kidney malformations. In the treat of malignancies radiation, alkylating antineoplastic agents, and epipodophyllotoxins are not used, and methotrexate can be used with caution and, the dose should be limited. Bone marrow transplants and hematopoietic stem cells transplants are also considered in the treatment of NBS. The supplementation of Vitamin E is also recommended."}

Manifestations of these changes include Copper wire arterioles where the central light reflex occupies most of the width of the arteriole and Silver wire arterioles where the central light reflex occupies all of the width of the arteriole, and \"arterio-venular (AV) nicking\" or \"AV nipping\", due to venous constriction and banking. - advanced retinopathy lesions, such as microaneurysms, blot hemorrhages and/or flame hemorrhages, ischemic changes (e. g. \"cotton wool spots\"), hard exudates and in severe cases swelling of the optic disc (optic disc edema), a ring of exudates around the retina called a \"macular star\" and visual acuity loss, typically due to macular involvement. Mild signs of hypertensive retinopathy can be seen quite frequently in normal people (3\u201314% of adult individuals aged \u226540 years), even without hypertension. Hypertensive retinopathy is commonly considered a diagnostic feature of a hypertensive emergency although it is not invariably present. There is an association between the grade of retinopathy and mortality. In a classic study in 1939 Keith and colleagues described the prognosis of people with differing severity of retinopathy. They showed 70% of those with grade 1 retinopathy were alive after 3 years whereas only 6% of those with grade 4 survived. The most widely used modern classification system bears their name. The role of retinopathy grading in risk stratification is debated, but it has been proposed that individuals with signs of hypertensive retinopathy signs, especially retinal hemorrhages, microaneurysms and cotton-wool spots, should be assessed carefully."}

Its medical name is tinea pedis, a member of the group of diseases or conditions known as tinea, most of which are dermatophytoses (fungal infections of the skin), which in turn are mycoses (broad category of fungal infections). Globally, athlete's foot affects about 15% of the population. Tinea pedis is caused by fungi such as Epidermophyton floccosum or fungi of the Trichophyton genus including T. rubrum and T. mentagrophytes. These fungi are typically transmitted in moist communal areas where people go barefoot, such as around swimming pools or in showers, and require a warm moist environment like the inside of a shoe to incubate. Fungal infection of the foot may be acquired (or reacquired) in many ways, such as by walking in an infected locker room, by using an infested bathtub, by sharing a towel used by someone with the disease, by touching the feet with infected fingers (such as after scratching another infected area of the body), or by wearing fungi-contaminated socks or shoes. Infection can often be prevented by keeping the feet dry by limiting the use of footwear that enclose the feet, or by remaining barefoot. The fungi may infect or spread to other areas of the body (such as by scratching one's feet and then touching one's groin). For each location on the body, the name of the condition changes. A fungal infection of the groin is called Tinea cruris, or commonly \"jock itch\".

The incidence is of 1/2000 pregnancies. Uterine inversion is often associated with significant Post-partum hemorrhage. Traditionally it was thought that it presented with haemodynamic shock \"out of proportion\" with blood loss, however blood loss has often been underestimated. The parasympathetic effect of traction on the uterine ligaments may cause bradycardia. Principles of management are to treat the shock and replace the uterus. The patient should be moved rapidly to the OR to facilitate anesthesia monitoring during this procedure. Usually this complication is only recognized after delivery of the placenta, wherein pitocin has already been started, which just exacerbates the problem. The uterus clamps down around the inversion making it very difficult to perform a replacement. This is a true obstetrical emergency, so extra doctors, nurses, anesthesiologists should be summoned to the room to assist. The pitocin should be turned off immediately.

Other causes of low white blood cell count include systemic lupus erythematosus, Hodgkin's lymphoma, some types of cancer, typhoid, malaria, tuberculosis, dengue, rickettsial infections, enlargement of the spleen, folate deficiencies, psittacosis, sepsis, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and Lyme disease. It has also been shown to be caused by deficiency in certain minerals, such as copper and zinc. Pseudoleukopenia can develop upon the onset of infection. The leukocytes (predominately neutrophils, responding to injury first) start migrating toward the site of infection, where they can be scanned. Their migration causes bone marrow to produce more WBCs to combat infection as well as to restore the leukocytes in circulation, but as the blood sample is taken upon the onset of infection, it contains low amount of WBCs, which is why it is termed \"pseudoleukopenia\". Certain medications can alter the number and function of white blood cells. Medications that can cause leukopenia include clozapine, an antipsychotic medication with a rare adverse effect leading to the total absence of all granulocytes (neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils). The antidepressant and smoking addiction treatment drug bupropion HCl (Wellbutrin) can also cause leukopenia with long-term use. Minocycline, a commonly prescribed antibiotic, is another drug known to cause leukopenia. There are also reports of leukopenia caused by divalproex sodium or valproic acid (Depakote), a drug used for epilepsy (seizures), mania (with bipolar disorder) and migraine. The anticonvulsant drug, lamotrigine, has been associated with a decrease in white blood cell count.

The primary form of hearing loss in otosclerosis is conductive hearing loss (CHL) whereby sounds reach the ear drum but are incompletely transferred via the ossicular chain in the middle ear, and thus partly fail to reach the inner ear (cochlea). This usually will begin in one ear but will eventually affect both ears with a variable course. On audiometry, the hearing loss is characteristically low-frequency, with higher frequencies being affected later. Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) has also been noted in patients with otosclerosis; this is usually a high-frequency loss, and usually manifests late in the disease. The causal link between otosclerosis and SNHL remains controversial. Over the past century, leading otologists and neurotologic researchers have argued whether the finding of SNHL late in the course of otosclerosis is due to otosclerosis or simply to typical presbycusis. Most patients with otosclerosis notice tinnitus (head noise) to some degree. The amount of tinnitus is not necessarily related to the degree or type of hearing impairment. Tinnitus develops due to irritation of the delicate nerve endings in the inner ear. Since the nerve carries sound, this irritation is manifested as ringing, roaring or buzzing. It is usually worse when the patient is fatigued, nervous or in a quiet environment. It may be that a genetic tendency to develop otosclerosis is inherited by some people.

Such reactions account for a significant proportion of perioperative anaphylactic reaction, especially in children with myelomeningocele. Type I natural rubber latex allergy is an IgE (immune) mediated reaction to proteins found in the Hevea brasiliensis tree, a type of rubber tree. Testing for type I natural rubber latex allergy is through blood testing to determine if the patient is producing IgE antibodies to latex proteins. Anaphylactic shock can be provoked in allergic persons by the previous use of latex in an area: latex is typically powdered to prevent sticking, latex proteins become attached to the particles of powder, and the powder becomes airborne when the latex item is used, triggering potentially life-threatening Type I reactions when the latex-contaminated powder is inhaled by susceptible persons. In radiological units latex allergy may mimic contrast medium allergy Type IV allergy, also known as allergic contact dermatitis, involves a delayed skin rash that is similar to poison ivy with blistering and oozing of the skin (see urushiol-induced contact dermatitis). It can be diagnosed through a positive skin patch test, although a negative test does not rule out a latex allergy. Severe irritation takes place if a latex catheter is inserted in the urinary tract of a person allergic to latex.

OMD are found in both children and adults. OMD that are commonly seen in children include tongue thrust that is also known as swallowing with an anterior tongue posture. OMD also refers to factors such as nonnutritive sucking behaviors, such as thumb sucking, clenching, bruxing, etc. that led to abnormal development of dentition and oral cavity. OMD in adult and geriatric population are due to various neurological impairments, oral hygiene, altered functioning of muscles due to aging, systemic diseases, etc. Tongue thrusting is a type of orofacial myofunctional disorder, which is defined as habitual resting or thrusting the tongue forward and/or sideways against or between the teeth while swallowing, chewing, resting, or speaking. Abnormal swallowing patterns push the upper teeth forward and away from the upper alveolar processes and cause open bites. In children, tongue thrusting is common due to immature oral behavior, narrow dental arch, prolonged upper respiratory tract infections, spaces between the teeth (diastema), muscle weakness, malocclusion, abnormal sucking habits, and open mouth posture due to structural abnormalities of genetic origin. Large tonsils and adenoids also contribute to tongue thrust swallowing. From the dental perspective, teeth move in relation to the balance of the soft tissue; the normal relationship of teeth lies in occlusion; and any deviation from the normal occlusion can lead to dental distress. Tongue posture plays an important role in swallowing and dentofacial growth. In case of tongue thrust swallowing, the tip of the tongue can come against or between the dentition; the midpoint may be collapsed or extended unilaterally or bilaterally; or the posterior part of the hard palate."}

The defect involves the whole area of the junction of the upper and lower chambers of the heart, i. e. where the atria join the ventricles. There is a large hole between the lower portion of the atria and the upper or `inlet' portion of the ventricles and this is associated with a significant abnormality of the valves separating the atria from the ventricles. The valves in effect become a common atrio-ventricular valve, and the severity of the defect depends largely on the supporting attachments of the valve to the ventricles and whether the valve allows dominant flow from the right atrium to right ventricle and from left atrium to left ventricle (\"unbalanced\" flow). The overall problems are similar to those of VSD but are more complicated. There is an increased flow of blood to the lungs through both the ventricular and atrial components of the defect. In addition, the abnormal atrio-ventricular valve invariably leaks, so that when the ventricles contract, blood flows not only forwards to the body and the lungs, but also backwards into the atria. The back-pressure effect on the atria causes congestion of blood in the left atrium in particular, and this in turn causes congestion in the veins draining the lungs. The effect on the baby is to worsen the heart failure that is associated with an isolated VSD and to hasten the onset of pulmonary hypertension. It should be mentioned that CAVSD is found in approximately one-third of babies who have Down syndrome, but it also occurs as an isolated abnormality."}

The most effective means of prevention and risk reduction is through education of the initial signs, and encouragement for people to seek ophthalmic medical attention if they have symptoms suggestive of a posterior vitreous detachment. Early examination allows detection of retinal tears which can be treated with laser or cryotherapy. This reduces the risk of retinal detachment in those who have tears from around 1:3 to 1:20.

Although some recommend avoiding activities that increase pressure in the eye, including diving and skydiving, there is little evidence to support this recommendation, especially in the general population. Nevertheless, ophthalmologists generally advise people with high degrees of myopia to try to avoid exposure to activities that have the potential for trauma, increase pressure on or within the eye itself, or include rapid acceleration and deceleration, such as bungee jumping or roller coaster rides. Intraocular pressure spikes occur during any activity accompanied by the Valsalva maneuver, including weightlifting. An epidemiological study suggests that heavy manual lifting at work may be associated with increased risk of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, but this relationship is not strong."}

If afflicting both eyes, the deterioration in vision can affect the patient's ability to drive a car or read normal print. It does not however lead to blindness per se. Keratoglobus continues to be a somewhat mysterious disease, but it can be successfully managed with a variety of clinical and surgical techniques. The patient is at risk for globe perforation because the thinned out cornea is extremely weak. Treatment includes the use of protective eye glasses. A number of surgical options are also available. Further progression of the disease usually leads to a need for corneal transplantation because of extreme thinning of the cornea. Primarily, large size penetrating keratoplasty has been advocated. Recent additions of techniques specifically for keratoglobus include the \"tuck procedure\", whereby a 12 mm corneo-scleral donor graft is taken and trimmed at its outer edges. A host pocket is formed at the limbal margin and the donor tissue is \"tucked\" into the host pocket. It is a much rarer condition than keratoconus, which is the most common of the cornea. Similar to keratoconus it is typically diagnosed in the patient's adolescent years and attains its most severe state in the twenties and thirties."}

The main medical risk factors are having bladder cancer or having conditions that cause chronic inflammation in the urethra. People over the age of 60 and white women have the highest risks. Diagnosis is established by transurethral biopsy. Types of urethral cancer include transitional cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and melanoma. Surgery is the most common treatment for cancer of the urethra. One of the following types of surgery may be done: Open excision, Electro-resection with flash, Laser surgery, Cystourethrectomy, Cystoprostatectomy, Anterior body cavity, or Incomplete or basic penectomy surgery. Chemotherapy is sometimes used to destroy urethral cancer cells. It is a systemic urethral cancer treatment (i. e. , destroys urethral cancer cells throughout the body) that is administered orally or intravenously. Medications are often used in combination to destroy urethral cancer that has metastasized. Commonly used drugs include cisplatin, vincristine, and methotrexate.

Molecules of glucose are linked into linear chains by \u03b1-1,4-glycosidic bonds. Additionally, branches of glucose are formed off of the chain by \u03b1-1,6-glycosidic bonds. 2 molecules of glucose are joined into an \u03b1-1,4-glycosidic bonds by an enzyme known as glycogen synthase. This bond may be broken by amylase when the body wishes to break down glycogen into glucose for energy. Glycogen branching enzyme is responsible for the required \u03b1-1,6-glycosidic bonds needed to start a branch off of these linear chains. Any disruption to this system results in a glycogen storage disease. There are currently 2 subcategories of glycogen storage diseases in horses: Type 1 polysaccharide storage myopathy, glycogen branching enzyme deficiency, and Type 2 polysaccharide storage myopathy. Type 1 PSSM is caused by an autosomal dominant genetic mutation known as GSY1. This mutation causes an up-regulation of glycogen synthase, and high levels of glycogen synthase relative to glycogen branching enzyme (GBE). This altered ratio of glycogen synthase to GBE results in glycogen molecules with long chains and few branches, making these molecules somewhat amylase resistant. The GSY1 mutation is associated with altered glucose metabolism (but normal glycogen metabolism), as well as accumulation of high levels of glycogen and abnormal polysaccharide in the muscles of the horse. Additionally, some horses have been shown to have insulin sensitivity, which improves glucose uptake by muscle cells and contributes to excessive glycogen storage that is already elevated secondary to the GSY1 mutation. Low levels of glycogen branching enzyme leads to a condition known as glycogen-branching enzyme deficiency."}

In endemic regions, coccidioidomycosis is responsible for 20% of cases of community-acquired pneumonia. Notable coccidioidomycosis signs and symptoms include a profound feeling of tiredness, fever, cough, headaches, rash, muscle pain, and joint pain. Fatigue can persist for many months after initial infection. The classic triad of coccidioidomycosis known as \"desert rheumatism\" includes the combination of fever, joint pains, and erythema nodosum. Nearly 3% to 5% of infected individuals do not recover from the initial acute infection and develop a chronic infection. This can take the form of chronic lung infection or widespread disseminated infection (affecting the tissues lining the brain, soft tissues, joints, and bone). Chronic infection is responsible for most of the morbidity and mortality. Chronic fibrocavitary disease is manifested by cough, sputum, fevers, night sweats and weight loss. Osteomyelitis, including involvement of the spine, and meningitis which may occur months to years after initial infection. Severe lung disease may develop in HIV-infected persons. After Coccidioides infection, coccidioidomycosis begins with Valley fever, which is its initial acute form.

Most commonly, however, people seem to associate coprolalia with Tourette syndrome. When it comes to Tourette syndrome, the pathology of what causes this type of tic is not well pinpointed, but there are several correlations. First of all, some research has pinpointed decreased grey matter thickness within the insula and sensorimotor cortex as the cause of some cases. Research notes that behavioral and functional brain imaging evidence indicates that the premonitory sensory phenomena (PSP) is associated with brain activity in the insular cortex, which is linked to interoceptive awareness. In the results of this research, it is noted that increased tic severity scores are associated with premonitory urges. Along with this, there is also evidence for the involvement of the insular cortex in the perception of urges. When conducting the research, the researchers of this report found that there was a relationship between grey matter thickness and PSP and that premonitory urges in Tourette syndrome are inversely associated with grey matter thickness in the sensorimotor and insular cortices. [30] Another possibility when it comes to Tourette syndrome is genetics. In a study conducted in 2017, researchers found that there was a possible genetic and neurobiological relationship of the disinhibition phenotype in Tourette syndrome patients. However, it is noted that more research would be needed to determine a direct relationship. [31] Coprolalia is not unique to tic disorders; it is also a rare symptom of other neurological disorders.

Parathyroid carcinoma is sometimes diagnosed during surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism. If the surgeon suspects carcinoma based on severity or invasion of surrounding tissues by a firm parathyroid tumor, aggressive excision is performed, including the thyroid and surrounding tissues as necessary. Agents such as calcimimetics (for example, cinacalcet) are used to mimic calcium and are able to activate the parathyroid calcium-sensing receptor (making the parathyroid gland \"think\" we have more calcium than we actually do), therefore lowering the calcium level, in an attempt to decrease the hypercalcemia."}

Boas lose weight and may develop clogged nares (nostrils), stomatitis, or secondary pneumonia. The disease can rapidly progress to produce nervous-system disorders, such as disorientation, corkscrewing of the head and neck, holding the head in abnormal and unnatural positions, rolling onto the back, or stargazing. Stomatitis, pneumonia, undifferentiated cutaneous sarcomas, lymphoproliferative disorders, and leukemia have all been observed in affected specimens. Burmese pythons generally show signs of central nervous system disease without manifestation of other clinical signs and regurgitation is seen only in boas. These are symptoms similar to those seen in specimens infected by Chlamydia\u2013specifically Chlamydophila psittaci, the so-called parrot's disease.

When awakened, people can usually recall the dream they were having, which will match the actions they were performing, but they will not be aware that they were moving. In a normal sleep cycle, REM sleep may be experienced at intervals of between 90 minutes and two hours every night, which means RBD episodes may occur up to four times a night. In a rare case, they may only happen once a week or once a month. Episodes occur more towards the morning hours because that is when REM sleep is more frequent. The actions in an episode can result in injuries to oneself or one's bed partner. People can also respond to other people while sleeping and not even know it. This causes them to be aware of things while they are sleeping, which can result in sleep deprivation. Rapid eye movement behavior disorder (RBD) occurs when there is a loss of normal voluntary muscle atonia during REM sleep resulting in motor behavior in response to dream content. It can be caused by adverse reactions to certain drugs or during drug withdrawal; however, it is most often associated with the elderly and in those with neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, for example multiple system atrophy and Lewy body dementia. RBD is categorized as either idiopathic or symptomatic. Idiopathic RBD is when the individual's sleep structure seems to be normal but there is a significant increase in the density of REM sleep as well as the percentage of slow wave sleep. This category of RBD is more strongly linked to having a genetic component, as seen throughout familial gene patterns."}

When exposed to cold temperatures, the blood supply to the fingers or toes, and in some cases the nose or earlobes, is markedly reduced; the skin turns pale or white (called pallor) and becomes cold and numb. 2. When the oxygen supply is depleted, the skin color turns blue (called cyanosis). 3. These events are episodic, and when the episode subsides or the area is warmed, the blood flow returns, and the skin color first turns red (rubor), and then back to normal, often accompanied by swelling, tingling, and a painful \"pins and needles\" sensation. All three color changes are observed in classic Raynaud's. However, not all patients see all of the aforementioned color changes in all episodes, especially in milder cases of the condition. Symptoms are thought to be due to reactive hyperemias of the areas deprived of blood flow. In pregnancy, this sign normally disappears owing to increased surface blood flow.

Similarly, tooth growth is stunted, with teeth failing to emerge form the gums or otherwise develop normally. Atrophy of the optic nerve occurs in approximately one third of individuals. This degradation leads to inhibited peripheral vision, and increased difficulty distinguishing colours. While not a defining feature, most sufferers of GAPO syndrome have coarse facial features, and abnormal structure of the middle portion of their faces, typically coupled with a large forehead. Individuals with the disease tend to have depressed nose bridges, protruding ears, and abnormally thick lips, though these symptoms are not unique to this disorder. No direct correlation has been found between GAPO syndrome and mental retardation, though cases of individuals having both have been reported. Due to the severity of the phenotype, GAPO syndrome can be diagnosed very early on. Most cases can be diagnosed by 6 months of age, and most symptoms will be apparent by age 2. GAPO syndrome is caused by a deletion in both copies of the ANTXR1 gene, which encodes Anthrax Toxin Receptor 1. This gene is critical for the creation of actin, and its disruption inhibits proper function of the actin network. As a result, individuals with GAPO syndrome have a buildup of extracellular matrix, and degraded cell adhesions."}

Limited growth, full-body alopecia (hair loss), and a distinctive appearance (a small face with a shallow recessed jaw, and a pinched nose) are all characteristics of progeria. Signs and symptoms of this progressive disease tend to become more marked as the child ages. Later, the condition causes wrinkled skin, atherosclerosis, kidney failure, loss of eyesight, and cardiovascular problems.

Musculoskeletal degeneration causes loss of body fat and muscle, stiff joints, hip dislocations, and other symptoms generally absent in the non-elderly population. Individuals usually retain typical mental and motor development. In normal conditions, the LMNA gene codes for a structural protein called prelamin A which undergoes a series of processing steps before attaining its final form, called lamin A.

Arthus repeatedly injected horse serum subcutaneously into rabbits. After four injections, he found that there was edema and that the serum was absorbed slowly. Further injections eventually led to gangrene. The Arthus reaction involves the in situ formation of antigen/antibody complexes after the intradermal injection of an antigen. If the animal/patient was previously sensitized (has circulating antibody), an Arthus reaction occurs. Typical of most mechanisms of the type III hypersensitivity, Arthus manifests as local vasculitis due to deposition of IgG-based immune complexes in dermal blood vessels. Activation of complement primarily results in cleavage of soluble complement proteins forming C5a and C3a, which activate recruitment of PMNs and local mast cell degranulation (requiring the binding of the immune complex onto Fc\u03b3RIII), resulting in an inflammatory response. Further aggregation of immune complex-related processes induce a local fibrinoid necrosis with ischemia-aggravating thrombosis in the tissue vessel walls. The end result is a localized area of redness and induration that typically lasts a day or so. Arthus reactions have been infrequently reported after vaccinations containing diphtheria and tetanus toxoid.

Babies are prone to this malformation because of the process during fetal development by which the abdominal organs form outside the abdominal cavity, later returning into it through an opening which will become the umbilicus. Hernias may be asymptomatic and present only as a bulge of the umbilicus. Symptoms may develop when the contracting abdominal wall causes pressure on the hernia contents. This results in abdominal pain or discomfort. These symptoms may be worsened by the patient lifting or straining. The causes of umbilical hernia are congenital and acquired malformation, but an apparent third cause is really a cause of a different type, a paraumbilical hernia. Congenital umbilical hernia is a congenital malformation of the navel (umbilicus). Among adults, it is three times more common in women than in men; among children, the ratio is roughly equal. It is also found to be more common in children of African descent."}

It is rare for symptoms to be undetected until adulthood, and usually adults have associated complications. The classic triad of intermittent abdominal pain, jaundice, and a right upper quadrant abdominal mass is found only in minority of patients. In infants, choledochal cysts usually lead to obstruction of the bile ducts and retention of bile. This leads to jaundice and an enlarged liver. If the obstruction is not relieved, permanent damage may occur to the liver - scarring and cirrhosis - with the signs of portal hypertension (obstruction to the flow of blood through the liver) and ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdomen). There is an increased risk of cancer in the wall of the cyst. In older individuals, choledochal cysts are more likely to cause abdominal pain and intermittent episodes of jaundice and occasionally cholangitis (inflammation within the bile ducts caused by the spread of bacteria from the intestine into the bile ducts). Pancreatitis also may occur. The cause of these complications may be related to either abnormal flow of bile within the ducts or the presence of gallstones They were classified into 5 types by Todani in 1977. Classification was based on site of the cyst or dilatation. Type I to IV has been subtyped. - Type I: Most common variety (80-90%) involving saccular or fusiform dilatation of a portion or entire common bile duct (CBD) with normal intrahepatic duct. - Type II: Isolated diverticulum protruding from the CBD."}

Because angiograms require x-rays to be visualized the number of times an individual can have it done over a year is limited by the guidelines for the amount of radiation they can be exposed to in a one-year period. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Magnetic resonance imaging has the ability to quantify the plaque anatomy and composition. This allows physicians to determine certain characteristics of the plaque such as how likely it is to break away from the wall and become an embolus. MRI does not use ionizing radiation, so the number of times that it is used on a single person is not a concern; however since it uses strong electric fields those who have metal implants in cannot use this technique. - Computed tomography (CT) Multidirectional computed tomography (MDCT) is better than regular CT scans, because it can provide a higher spatial resolution and it has a shorter acquisition time. MDCT uses x-rays to obtain the image; however it can identify the composition of the plaque. Thus it can be determined whether the plaque is calcified plaque and lipid-rich plaque, so the inherent risks can be determined. Subjects are exposed to a substantial amount of radiation with this procedure, so their use is limited. Asymptomatic individuals with intracranial stenosis are typically told to take over the counter platelet inhibitors like aspirin whereas those with symptomatic presentation are prescribed anti-coagulation medications. For asymptomatic persons the idea is to stop the buildup of plaque from continuing. They are not experiencing symptoms; however if more build up occurs it is likely they will. For symptomatic individuals it is necessary to try and reduce the amount of stenosis. The anti-coagulation medications reduce the likelihood of further buildup while also trying to break down the current build up on the surface without an embolism forming."}

The abnormal \u201chooded\u201d foreskin calls attention to the condition. However, not all newborns with partial foreskin development have hypospadias, as some have a normal urinary opening with a hooded foreskin, which is called \u201cchordee without hypospadias\u201d. Megameatus with intact prepuce variant of hypospadias occurs when the foreskin is normal and the hypospadias is concealed. The condition is discovered during newborn circumcision or later in childhood when the foreskin begins to retract. A newborn with normal-appearing foreskin and a straight penis who is discovered to have hypospadias after a circumcision was started can have circumcision completed without worry for jeopardizing future hypospadias repair. Hypospadias is almost never discovered after a circumcision. Surgery is usually recommended for hypospadias, with the goal to restore normal appearance and function to the penis. A urinary opening that is not surrounded by glans tissue is more likely to \u201cspray\u201d the urine, which can cause a man to sit to urinate because he cannot reliably stand and hit the toilet. Downward curvature of the penis can impair sexual activity as an adult. Surgery extends the urinary channel to the end of the penis, straightens bending, and corrects the foreskin abnormality by either circumcision or by repairing it to look normal (\u201cprepucioplasty\u201d), depending on the desire of care-givers. When the hypospadias is third degree (penoscrotal), or has associated birth defects such as chordee or cryptorchidism, the best management can be a more complicated decision.

It is localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane. The enzyme has steroid 18-hydroxylase activity to synthesize aldosterone and other steroids. Aldosterone synthase is found within the zona glomerulosa at the outer edge of the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone synthase normally is not ACTH sensitive, and only activated by angiotensin II. Aldosterone causes the tubules of the kidneys to retain sodium and water. This increases the volume of fluid in the body, and drives up blood pressure. Steroid hormones are synthesized from cholesterol within the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone and corticosterone share the first part of their biosynthetic pathway. The last part is either mediated by the aldosterone synthase (for aldosterone) or by the 11\u03b2-hydroxylase (for corticosterone). The genes encoding aldosterone synthase and 11-hydroxylase are 95% identical and are close together on chromosome 8. In individuals with GRA, there is unequal crossing over so that the 5' regulatory region of the 11-hydroxylase gene is fused to the coding region of the aldosterone synthase. The product of this hybrid gene is aldosterone synthase that is ACTH-sensitive in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal gland. Although in normal subjects, ACTH accelerates the first step of aldosterone synthesis, ACTH normally has no effect on the activity of aldosterone synthase."}

The mutation causes overproduction of an enzyme that accelerates blood clot breakdown.

Consequently, stored platelet plasminogen is converted to plasmin, which is thought to play a role in degrading a number of proteins stored in platelet \u03b1-granules. These proteins include platelet factor V, Von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, thrombospondin-1, and osteonectin. There is also a quantitative deficiency in the platelet protein multimerin 1 (MMRN1). Furthermore, upon QPD platelet activation, u-PA can be released into forming clots and accelerate clot lysis, resulting in delayed-onset bleeding (12-24hrs after injury).

For example, Jaundice only occurs in relatively small subset of cases, and in some cases abnormal lab results were not seen until 15 weeks or more after the onset of symptoms. The causes of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy are still not fully understood. Hormones and genetic factors are likely to be important in the pathogenesis of the disease. A number of features of the disease suggest a link to hormones: - ICP occurs in the third trimester at the time when hormone levels are at their highest. - Twin and triplet pregnancies, which are associated with higher hormone levels, show a higher incidence of ICP. - ICP resolves quickly after delivery, when placental hormone production ceases. - Older high-dose estrogen oral contraceptive pills could cause features of ICP. Estrogens, and particularly glucuronides such as estradiol-17\u03b2-D-glucuronide, have been shown to cause cholestasis in animal studies, by reducing bile acid uptake by hepatocytes. Treatment with progesterone in the third trimester of pregnancy has been shown to be associated with the development of ICP, and levels of metabolites of progesterone, particularly sulfated progesterone, are higher in patients with ICP than unaffected women, suggesting that progesterone also has a role in ICP. Clustering of cases of ICP in families, geographic variation in rates of ICP, and recurrence of ICP in 45-70% of subsequent pregnancies all suggest a genetic component to the disease. Genetic mutations in the hepatocellular transport protein ABCB4 (MDR3), which controls secretion of phosphatidylcholine into bile, have been found in 15% of cases of ICP."}

Fowl plague, however, also included Newcastle disease until as recently as the 1950s. Between 1959 and 1995, there were 15 recorded occasions of the emergence of HPAI viruses in poultry, but losses were minimal. Between 1996 and 2008 however, HPAI outbreaks in poultry have occurred at least 11 times and 4 of these outbreaks have involved millions of birds. In the 1990s, the world's poultry population grew 76% in developing countries and 23% in developed countries, contributing to the increased prevalence of avian influenza. Before the 1990s, HPAI caused high mortality in poultry, but infections were sporadic and contained. Outbreaks have become more common due to the high density and frequent movement of flocks from intensive poultry production. Influenza A/H5N1 was first isolated from a goose in China in 1996. Human infections were first reported in 1997 in Hong Kong. Since 2003, more than 700 human cases of Asian HPAI H5N1 have been reported to the WHO, primarily from 15 countries in Asia, Africa, the Pacific, Europe, and the Middle East, though over 60 countries have been affected. Genetic factors in distinguishing between \"human flu viruses\" and \"avian flu viruses\" include: There are many subtypes of avian influenza viruses, but only some strains of five subtypes have been known to infect humans: H5N1, H7N3, H7N7, H7N9, and H9N2. At least one person, an elderly woman in Jiangxi Province, China, died of pneumonia in December 2013 from the H10N8 strain, the first human fatality confirmed to be caused by that strain. Most human cases of the avian flu are a result of either handling dead infected birds or from contact with infected fluids. It can also be spread through contaminated surfaces and droppings."}

Some patients also have continuous tremors of various motor groups, known as myokymia. Other patients have nystagmus, vertigo, tinnitus, diplopia or seizures. The various symptoms of EA are caused by dysfunction of differing areas. Ataxia, the most common symptom, is due to misfiring of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. This is either due to direct malfunction of these cells, such as in EA2, or improper regulation of these cells, such as in EA1. Seizures are likely due to altered firing of hippocampal neurons (KCNA1 null mice have seizures for this reason). Type 1 episodic ataxia (EA1) is characterized by attacks of generalized ataxia induced by emotion or stress, with myokymia both during and between attacks. This disorder is also known as episodic ataxia with myokymia (EAM), hereditary paroxysmal ataxia with neuromyotonia and Isaacs-Mertens syndrome. Onset of EA1 occurs during early childhood to adolescence and persists throughout the patient's life. Attacks last from seconds to minutes. Mutations of the gene KCNA1, which encodes the voltage-gated potassium channel K1. 1, are responsible for this subtype of episodic ataxia. K1."}

A gynandromorph can have bilateral asymmetry\u2014one side female and one side male. Alternatively, the distribution of male and female tissue can be more haphazard. Bilateral gynandromorphy arises very early in development, typically when the organism has between 8 and 64 cells. Later stages produce a more random pattern. The cause of this phenomenon is typically, but not always, an event in mitosis during early development. While the organism contains only a few cells, one of the dividing cells does not split its sex chromosomes typically. This leads to one of the two cells having sex chromosomes that cause male development and the other cell having chromosomes that cause female development. For example, an XY cell undergoing mitosis duplicates its chromosomes, becoming XXYY. Usually this cell would divide into two XY cells, but in rare occasions the cell may divide into an X cell and an XYY cell."}

A cap more than 2 cm thick, indicates malignant transformation of a tumor. The cartilage cap merges with the epiphyseal area of the long bones called spongiosa. In the spongiosa, the chondrocytes are arranged in accordance with the epiphyseal growth plate. The spongiosa of the stalk continues with the underlying cancellous bone.

For this reason, in gonadal dysgenesis the accompanying hormonal failure also prevents the development of secondary sex characteristics in either sex, resulting in a sexually infantile female appearance and infertility. This condition will occur if there is an absence of both M\u00fcllerian inhibiting factor and testosterone. The absence of testosterone will result in regression of the Wolffian ducts; normal male internal reproductive tracts will not develop. The absence of M\u00fcllerian inhibiting factor will allow the M\u00fcllerian ducts to differentiate into the oviducts and uterus.

Involvement of the trigeminal nerve can cause numbness of the face. Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2 refers to shingles of the geniculate ganglion. After initial infection, varicella zoster virus lies dormant in nerve cells in the body, where it is kept in check by the immune system. Given the opportunity, for example during an illness that suppresses the immune system, the virus travels to the end of the nerve cell, where it causes the symptoms described above. The affected ganglion is responsible for the movements of facial muscles, the touch sensation of a part of ear and ear canal, the taste function of the frontal two-thirds of the tongue, and the moisturization of the eyes and the mouth. The syndrome specifically refers to the combination of this entity with weakness of the muscles activated by the facial nerve. In isolation, the latter is called Bell's Palsy. However, as with shingles, the lack of lesions does not definitely exclude the existence of a herpes infection. Even before the eruption of vesicles, varicella zoster virus can be detected from the skin of the ear.

Symptoms include muscle wasting and weakness, muscle rigidity, developmental delays, progressive loss of vision leading to blindness, convulsions, impaired swallowing, paralysis, and dementia. Children may become comatose. Untreated, most children with this form of MLD die by age 5, often much sooner. - Children with the juvenile form of MLD (onset between 3 and 10 years of age) usually begin with impaired school performance, mental deterioration, and dementia and then develop symptoms similar to the late infantile form but with slower progression. Age of death is variable, but normally within 10 to 15 years of symptom onset although some juveniles can live for several decades or longer after onset. - The adult form commonly begins after age 16 often with an onset in the 4th or 5th decade of life and presents as a psychiatric disorder or progressive dementia. Adult-onset MLD usually progresses more slowly than the late infantile and juvenile forms, with a protracted course of a decade or more. Palliative care can help with many of the symptoms and usually improves quality of life and longevity. Carriers have low enzyme levels compared to their family population (\"normal\" levels vary from family to family) but even low enzyme levels are adequate to process the body's sulfatide. MLD is directly caused by a deficiency of the enzyme arylsulfatase A (ARSA) and is characterized by enzyme activity in leukocytes that is less than 10% of normal controls. However, assay of the ARSA enzyme activity alone is not sufficient for diagnosis; ARSA pseudodeficiency, which is characterized by enzyme activity that is 5~20% of normal controls does not cause MLD. Without this enzyme, sulfatides build up in many tissues of the body, eventually destroying the myelin sheath of the nervous system."}

Some patients have cravings for salt or salty foods due to the loss of sodium through their urine. Hyperpigmentation of the skin may be seen, particularly when the patient lives in a sunny area, as well as darkening of the palmar crease, sites of friction, recent scars, the vermilion border of the lips, and genital skin.

Characteristic sites of darkening are skin creases (e. g. , of the hands), nipple, and the inside of the cheek (buccal mucosa); also, old scars may darken. This occurs because melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) and ACTH share the same precursor molecule, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). After production in the anterior pituitary gland, POMC gets cleaved into gamma-MSH, ACTH, and beta-lipotropin. The subunit ACTH undergoes further cleavage to produce alpha-MSH, the most important MSH for skin pigmentation. In secondary and tertiary forms of adrenal insufficiency, skin darkening does not occur, as ACTH is not overproduced."}

An individual may experience instability in the knee once they resume walking and other activities, and they may feel their knee is \"giving out\". Loss of full range of motion, and discomfort along the joint line are also common symptoms of an ACL injury. ACL injury is most commonly a non-contact injury that occurs when an individual stops suddenly or plants his or her foot hard into the ground (cutting). ACL injury also has been linked to heavy or stiff-legged landing; the knee rotating while landing, especially when the knee is in an unnatural position. The ACL is responsible for providing stability in knee rotation, as it prevents the tibia from shifting in front of the femur. Significantly, many ACL injuries occur in athletes landing flat on their heels. This movement directs the forces directly up the tibia into the knee, while the straight-knee position places the anterior femoral condyle on the back-slanted portion of the tibia. The resultant forward slide of the tibia relative to the femur is restrained primarily by the now-vulnerable ACL. ACL injuries also can be caused by direct contact or trauma, such as in a motor vehicle collision or from a tackle in football. A severe form of ACL injury caused by direct contact is called the \"unhappy triad,\" also known as the \"terrible triad,\" or \"O'Donaghue's triad. \" The \"unhappy triad\" involves injury of the anterior cruciate ligament, the medial collateral ligament, and the medial meniscus.

Much less often it is a secondary malignancy, one in which the cancer has spread to the penis from elsewhere. The staging of penile cancer is determined by the extent of tumor invasion, nodal metastasis, and distant metastasis. The T portion of the AJCC TNM staging guidelines are for the primary tumor as follows: - TX: Primary tumor cannot be assessed. - T0: No evidence of primary tumor. - Tis: Carcinoma in situ. - Ta: Noninvasive verrucous carcinoma. - T1a: Tumor invades subepithelial connective tissue without lymph vascular invasion and is not poorly differentiated (i. e. , grade 3\u20134)."}
{"input": "PDP has a number of visible symptoms.", "language": "en", "domain": "disease", "full_context": "PDP has a number of visible symptoms. Most important clinical features are: pachydermia (thickening and wrinkling of the skin), furrowing of the face and scalp, periostosis (swelling of periarticular tissue and shaggy periosteal new bone formation of long bones) and digital clubbing (enlargement of fingertips). Other features include excessive sweating, arthralgia and gastrointestinal abnormalities. An overview of all symptoms is provided in table 2. Table 2. Overview of symptoms Although the pathogenesis of PDP is still not fully understood, two theories have been suggested: - The neurogenic theory proposes that stimulation of the vagus nerve leads to vasodilation, increased blood flow and PDP. - The humoral theory proposes that mediators such as growth factors or inflammatory mediators are increased, leading to fibroblast proliferation and PDP. This theory is explained in the next sections. Recently, it has been suggested that the locally acting mediator prostaglandin E (PGE) plays a role in the pathogenesis of PDP. In PDP patients, high levels of PGE and decreased levels of PGE-M (the metabolite of PGE) were observed. PGE can mimic the activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts (respectively building and breaking down bone tissue). This is why acroosteolysis and periosteal bone formation can be explained by the action of PGE. Furthermore, PGE has vasodilatory effects, which is consistent with prolonged local vasodilation in digital clubbing. Elevated levels of PGE in PDP patients are associated with mutations of HPGD gene."}
{"input": "Symptoms generally arise later after one takes a shower.", "language": "en", "domain": "disease", "full_context": "Symptoms generally arise later after one takes a shower. It is unusual to notice the eruptions immediately. Symptoms can last from a few days up to two weeks, the shorter time being the norm. The reaction is identified by severe itching around small red papules 1mm to 1. 5 cm in size located on areas of skin that were covered by water-permeable clothing or hair during ocean swimming. Initial swimmer exposure to the free-floating larvae produces no effects, as each organism possesses only a single undeveloped nematocyst which is inactive while suspended in sea water. However, due to their microscopic size and sticky bodies, large concentrations of larvae can become trapped in minute gaps between skin and clothing or hair. Once the swimmer leaves the ocean, the organisms stuck against the skin die and automatically discharge their nematocysts when crushed, dried out, or exposed to fresh water. This is why symptoms usually do not appear until the swimmer dries themselves in the sun or takes a freshwater shower without first removing the affected clothing. Treatment is symptomatic. Treatment does not require a doctor's attention unless the case is severe, with most affected using a topical anti-itch cream (diphenhydramine) and a cortisone solution (hydrocortisone). Do not scratch the area, and avoid any clothing that may irritate the affected area; scratching will result in localized swelling and intense itching. Upon exiting the water, prompt removal of swim clothing (while it is still wet) followed by a warm sea-water shower largely negates the risk of Seabather's eruption even in endemic areas. A hot freshwater shower with soap (paying particular attention to the hair and areas covered by the suit) is a somewhat less-effective alternative if uncontaminated seawater is unavailable."}

Prospective studies of patients presenting with clubbing have not yet been performed, and hence there is no conclusive evidence of these associations. Clubbing is associated with: - Lung disease: - Lung cancer, mainly non-small-cell (54% of all cases), not seen frequently in small-cell lung cancer (< 5% of cases) - Interstitial lung disease most commonly idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - Complicated tuberculosis - Suppurative lung disease: lung abscess, empyema, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis - Mesothelioma of the pleura - Arteriovenous fistula or malformation - Heart disease: - Any disease featuring chronic hypoxia - Congenital cyanotic heart disease (most common cardiac cause) - Subacute bacterial endocarditis - Atrial myxoma (benign tumor) - Tetralogy of Fallot - Gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary: - Malabsorption - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis - Cirrhosis, especially in primary biliary cirrhosis - Hepatopulmonary syndrome, a complication of cirrhosis - Others: - Graves' disease (autoimmune hyperthyroidism) \u2013 in this case it is known as thyroid acropachy - Familial and racial clubbing and \"pseudoclubbing\" (people of African descent often have what appears to be clubbing) - Vascular anomalies of the affected arm such as an axillary artery aneurysm (in unilateral clubbing) Nail clubbing is not specific to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Therefore, in patients with COPD with significant degrees of clubbing, a search for signs of bronchogenic carcinoma (or other causes of clubbing) might be indicated. A congenital form is also known. This may be inherited either in an autosomal recessive or dominant fashion. In these cases the thumbs are almost always affected: the other fingers may be affected. A special form of clubbing is hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy, known in continental Europe as Pierre Marie-Bamberger syndrome. This is the combination of clubbing and thickening of periosteum (connective tissue lining of the bones) and synovium (lining of joints), and is often initially diagnosed as arthritis. It is commonly associated with lung cancer. Primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is HPOA without signs of pulmonary disease. This form has a hereditary component, although subtle cardiac abnormalities can occasionally be found. It is known eponymously as the Touraine\u2013Solente\u2013Gol\u00e9 syndrome. This condition has been linked to mutations in the gene on the fourth chromosome (4q33-q34) coding for the enzyme 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (HPGD); this leads to decreased breakdown of prostaglandin E2 and elevated levels of this substance."}

It has been shown that stress can significantly raise prolactin levels, which should make stress a diagnostic differential, though it usually is not considered such. Most pituitary tumors are sporadic \u2014 they are not genetically passed from parents to offspring. The majority of moderately raised prolactin levels (up to 5000 mIU/L) are not due to microprolactinomas but other causes. The effects of some prescription drugs are the most common. Other causes are other pituitary tumours and normal pregnancy and breastfeeding. This is discussed more under hyperprolactinaemia. The xenoestrogenic chemical Bisphenol-A has been shown to lead to hyperprolactinaemia and growth of prolactin-producing pituitary cells. The increasing and prolonged exposure of Bisphenol-A from childhood on, may contribute to the growth of a Prolactinoma. A doctor will test for prolactin blood levels in women with unexplained milk secretion (galactorrhea) or irregular menses or infertility, and in men with impaired sexual function and, in rare cases, milk secretion. If prolactin is high, a doctor will test thyroid function and ask first about other conditions and medications known to raise prolactin secretion. The doctor will also request a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is the most sensitive test for detecting pituitary tumors and determining their size."}

Fever is not very specific, as it occurs in many other common illnesses, may be absent in those with severe disease, malnutrition or in the elderly. In addition, a cough is frequently absent in children less than 2 months old. More severe signs and symptoms in children may include blue-tinged skin, unwillingness to drink, convulsions, ongoing vomiting, extremes of temperature, or a decreased level of consciousness. Bacterial and viral cases of pneumonia usually present with similar symptoms. Some causes are associated with classic, but non-specific, clinical characteristics. Pneumonia caused by Legionella may occur with abdominal pain, diarrhea, or confusion, while pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae is associated with rusty colored sputum, and pneumonia caused by Klebsiella may have bloody sputum often described as \"currant jelly\". Bloody sputum (known as hemoptysis) may also occur with tuberculosis, Gram-negative pneumonia, and lung abscesses as well as more commonly with acute bronchitis. Mycoplasma pneumonia may occur in association with swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck, joint pain, or a middle ear infection. Viral pneumonia presents more commonly with wheezing than does bacterial pneumonia. Pneumonia was historically divided into \"typical\" and \"atypical\" based on the belief that the presentation predicted the underlying cause.

V\u00e1c wurde auch als \"Wac civitas\" im Jahr 1075 in einem Stiftungsbrief der Abtei in Garamszentbenedek erw\u00e4hnt. Der Stadtname V\u00e1c kommt wahrscheinlich von einem Personennamen.

Damals soll in dieser Gegend ein Einsiedler namens V\u00e1c gelebt haben. Ein weiterer Erkl\u00e4rungsversuch leitet den Stadtnamen vom ungarischen Stamm Vath ab. Das Wort V\u00e1c kommt aus dem Slavischen und bedeutet: wichtige Siedlung oder Zentrum. Der mittelalterliche Stadtkern war urspr\u00fcnglich eine Burg bzw. Festung im s\u00fcdlichen Teil der Innenstadt, die auf einem H\u00fcgel am Flussufer errichtet wurde. Im Jahre 1241 fielen mongolische Tataren in V\u00e1c ein.

Bis zur politischen Wende im Jahr 1989 war die Stadt durch das Elektronikkombinat Tesla gepr\u00e4gt, das der Hauptarbeitgeber f\u00fcr Ro\u017enov und seine Umgebung war. Nach der Einf\u00fchrung der Marktwirtschaft ging der Gro\u00dfbetrieb \u201eTesla\u201c, dessen Hauptabnehmer zuvor die Ostblockstaaten und insbesondere die Sowjetunion gewesen waren, ein. Dadurch kam es zu hoher Arbeitslosigkeit. Aus einigen TESLA-Betrieben gr\u00fcndeten sich neue Firmen, die die Tradition des einstigen Werkes fortsetzten. Relativ neu sind Fertigungsst\u00e4tten f\u00fcr Solarmodule und Solarzellen. Weiterhin siedelten sich in Ro\u017enov und Umgebung Zweigbetriebe von Bosch, Siemens, Brose oder Motorola an. In Ro\u017enov stehen eine Schwimmhalle, mehrere Freib\u00e4der, ein Campingplatz sowie Tennis- und Golfanlagen zur Verf\u00fcgung. F\u00fcr den Wintersport sind Skilifte und Loipen vorhanden. In der Stadt befinden sich au\u00dferdem das 1957 errichtete Skiareal Na Bu\u010disk\u00e1ch, das aus drei Klein- und einer Mittelschanze besteht. Einer der bekanntesten Anziehungspunkte in Ro\u017enov ist das Walachische Freilichtmuseum (Vala\u0161sk\u00e9 muzeum v p\u0159\u00edrod\u011b), in dem man die aus verschiedenen Orten stammende walachische Volksarchitektur gesammelt hat und das Leben der Menschen in der fr\u00fcheren Zeit darstellt."}

Von H\u00fasav\u00edk aus kann man Walbeobachtungsfahrten unternehmen, bei denen man meist Buckelwale (aber auch Zwergwale, Schweinswale oder Blauwale) oder Delfine sieht. In der N\u00e4he des Hafens befindet sich das Walmuseum in H\u00fasav\u00edk, das vom Europ\u00e4ischen Walzentrum betrieben wird und durchweg dreisprachig (Isl\u00e4ndisch, Englisch und Deutsch) ist.

Der Grund f\u00fcr die Namens\u00e4nderung ist nicht klar. Die Pfarrei Czechowicz im Teschener Dekanat wurde im Peterspfennigregister des Jahres 1447 erw\u00e4hnt. Dziedzice wurde erstmals im Jahr 1465 als Dziedzicz[e] erw\u00e4hnt. Der name Dziedzice ist auch patronymisch abgeleitet vom Vorname Dziad. Politisch geh\u00f6rten sie urspr\u00fcnglich zum Herzogtum Teschen, dieses bestand ab 1290 in der Zeit. Seit 1327 bestand die Lehensherrschaft des K\u00f6nigreichs B\u00f6hmen, seit 1526 geh\u00f6rte es zur Habsburgermonarchie."}

Die Lipodystrophie ist ein Stoffwechselsyndrom, das bei HIV-Infizierten unter antiretroviraler Therapie auftreten kann. \u00c4ltere Studien wiesen auf ein Auftreten bei 30-50 % unter HAART stehender Patienten hin. Untersuchungen bei aktuellen Behandlungsregimes zeigen jedoch ein deutlich selteneres Auftreten, so wird in der Erstlinientherapie eine j\u00e4hrliche Inzidenz von nur 5-10 % ausgewiesen, die in den Folgejahren weniger fortzuschreiten scheint. Die Lipodystrophie geht einher mit einer Erh\u00f6hung der Blutfette und des Serumcholesterins sowie einer Umverteilung des Fettgewebes, wobei sowohl atrophische als auch hypertrophische Ver\u00e4nderungen auftreten k\u00f6nnen.

Es handelt sich in den meisten F\u00e4llen um ein autosomal-dominant vererbtes Leiden, daher gibt es H\u00e4ufungen innerhalb einzelner Familien. In den meisten F\u00e4llen wird die CMT durch eine Mutation auf dem Chromosom 17 hervorgerufen. CMT ist eine vererbliche Erkrankung der peripheren Nerven, bei der durch eine genetische Mutation entweder der Nervenzellfortsatz, Axon genannt, oder die isolierende Myelinschicht gesch\u00e4digt wird. Das Myelin k\u00f6nnte mit der Kunststoffisolierung um ein Elektrokabel verglichen werden. Es wird die saltatorische Erregungsleitung, also die Fortleitung von Nervenimpulsen in peripheren Nerven behindert, sodass die Befehle des Gehirns die Muskeln nicht richtig erreichen k\u00f6nnen. Aus der Denervierung folgt eine Schw\u00e4che und ein Abbau der betroffenen Muskulatur. Anders als bei den Muskeldystrophien werden die Menschen, die CMT haben, mit normalen Muskeln geboren. Die Muskeln schwinden (atrophieren), weil die von CMT beeintr\u00e4chtigten Nerven die Befehle des Gehirns f\u00fcr bestimmte Muskelbewegungen nicht exakt \u00fcbertragen k\u00f6nnen.

Aufgrund dieses Mangels kommt es im Blut zur Abnahme der Albumine (Hypalbumin\u00e4mie) und einhergehend zum Absinken des kolloidosmotischen Drucks mit der Folge, dass Gewebsfl\u00fcssigkeit \u2013 vor allem im Bauchbereich \u2013 nicht wieder in die ven\u00f6sen Kapillaren aufgenommen werden kann. Dieser Prozess findet allerdings nur bei einem Teil der Kinder statt. Als ausschlaggebende Faktoren f\u00fcr das Auftreten von Kwashiorkor in Malawi wurden im Jahr 2013 die Zusammensetzung der Darmflora zusammen mit der lokalen Di\u00e4t ausgemacht. Es gelang, durch \u00dcbertragung der Darmflora bei M\u00e4usen die entsprechenden Symptome zu verursachen. \u00dcber einen Zusammenhang zwischen dem Auftreten der Symptome von Kwashiorkor und der Aufnahme von Aflatoxinen mit der Nahrung wird noch diskutiert. Das Krankheitsbild zeigt den charakteristischen Hungerbauch, der durch Wassereinlagerungen am ganzen K\u00f6rper, vor allem aber am Bauch, sowie eine vergr\u00f6\u00dferte Leber verursacht wird. Des Weiteren treten Hautver\u00e4nderungen, oft auch eine Entf\u00e4rbung der Haare, Wachstumsst\u00f6rungen, Durchfall und Gewichtsverlust auf, letzterer allerdings nicht so stark wie beim Marasmus. Auch sind starke psychische Ver\u00e4nderungen wie Teilnahmslosigkeit und Apathie zu beobachten. Geheilte Kinder weisen auch nach Ende der Erkrankung eine Wachstumsverminderung auf. Ein hemmender Einfluss des Mangelzustands auf die geistige Entwicklung ist nicht gesichert. Die Dauer von Kwashiorkor-Episoden kann bei ausreichender L\u00e4nge am Haupthaar abgesch\u00e4tzt werden, da unter Proteinmangel die Haare mit verringerter Pigmentierung wachsen.

Ab einer Verminderung der ADAMTS13-Aktivit\u00e4t unter 10 % bilden sich Thromben in den kleinsten Gef\u00e4\u00dfen des K\u00f6rpers. Diese Thromben bestehen aus gro\u00dfen vWF-Multimeren und aktivierten Blutpl\u00e4ttchen. Durch die Gef\u00e4\u00dfverschl\u00fcsse kommt es zur Isch\u00e4mie der nachgeschalteten Gewebe.

Als Hauptvektor fungieren die Stechm\u00fccken Culex tarsalis und Culex pipiens, es ist auch eine Kontaktinfektion mit Speichel erkrankter Tiere m\u00f6glich. Als Virusreservoir dienen Wildv\u00f6gel und Nagetiere. Sie sind, wie auch Haustiere, prinzipiell f\u00fcr das Virus empf\u00e4nglich, entwickeln aber keine oder nur milde Symptome. Die Inkubationszeit betr\u00e4gt 1 bis 7 Tage. Die Erkrankung \u00e4u\u00dfert sich relativ unspezifisch. Das Virus ist weniger neurotrop als die anderen Pferdeenzephalomyelitisviren. Es verursacht h\u00e4ufig Sch\u00e4digungen der Blutgef\u00e4\u00dfe und kann viele Organe befallen. Klinisch treten Fieber, Abgeschlagenheit, Fressunlust und je nach Organbefall weitere Symptome auf. Die Mortalit\u00e4t bei Pferden kann bis zu 80 % betragen, der Tod tritt gew\u00f6hnlich innerhalb 2\u20137 Tagen ein.

Auf die immer h\u00e4ufiger werdende mediale Verbreitung der Managerkrankheit reagierte der Arzt und Professor Alfred Marchionini, indem er 1956 in M\u00fcnchen in Anlehnung an das Prinzip des English weekend die Gesellschaft \u201eFreies Wochenende\u201c mit dem Ziel gr\u00fcndete, \u201edie Reinigung des Sonnabends und des Sonntags von allen Massenveranstaltungen, Kongressen und politischen Versammlungen\u201c (ausgenommen: die religi\u00f6sen und sportlichen Veranstaltungen) durchzuf\u00fchren und auch, um \u201eder sonnabend-sonnt\u00e4glichen Jagd nach \u00dcberstunden ein Ende zu bereiten\u201c.

Die Lageanomalien des Hodens k\u00f6nnen in zwei Gruppen eingeteilt werden. Der Hodenhochstand (Hodenretention) ist ein ausgebliebener bzw. unvollst\u00e4ndiger Abstieg des Hodens, die Hodenektopie eine Abweichung vom vorgegebenen Pfad."}

Da zudem die Erkrankung im Rahmen psychiatrischer Erkrankungen wie einer Psychose, einem Delir oder einer Demenz auftreten kann, fordern manche Psychiater, die Erkrankung nicht als Syndrom, sondern als Symptom zu bezeichnen. Lange Zeit nahm man an, das Capgras-Syndrom sei mit der Prosopagnosie, der generellen Unf\u00e4higkeit, Gesichter zu erkennen, verwandt. Neuere Forschungsarbeiten zeigen jedoch, dass die Gesichtserkennung ungest\u00f6rt ist, wohingegen die Verkn\u00fcpfung zu emotionalen K\u00f6rper-Reaktionen fehle. Das Fehlen einer emotionalen Reaktion kann beispielsweise durch die Elektrodermale Aktivit\u00e4t festgestellt werden, da sich der Hautwiderstand bei emotionalen Empfindungen wie beim Anblick vertrauter Personen \u00e4ndert.

Dank der Therapiem\u00f6glichkeiten mit modernen Behandlungsmethoden (Intensivstation und -therapie, Benzodiazepine, Neuroleptika, Elektrokonvulsionstherapie) \u00fcberleben inzwischen fast alle betroffenen Patienten. Die Diskussion, ob die \"pernizi\u00f6se\" oder \"maligne\" Katatonie mit dem lebensbedrohlichen Krankheitsbild \"Malignes Neuroleptisches Syndrom\" (MNS) identisch ist, wurde bisher nicht abschlie\u00dfend gel\u00f6st. Der Krankheitsverlauf ist \u00e4hnlich, das Bild der t\u00f6dlichen Katatonie ist vor \u00fcber 100 Jahren erstbeschrieben, das Bild des MNS existiert dagegen erst seit Einf\u00fchrung der Neuroleptika in den 1960er Jahren. Katatone Zust\u00e4nde werden zun\u00e4chst meist mit Benzodiazepinen behandelt, um die Katalepsie zu durchbrechen und die dabei oft vorhandene starke Angst zu vermindern. Die Behandlung erfolgt weiterhin, wie bei den anderen schizophrenen Formen, mit Antipsychotika. In der Langzeitbehandlung k\u00f6nnen Stimmungsstabilisatoren wie Lithium, Valproins\u00e4ure, Carbamazepin und Lamotrigin \u00fcberaus hilfreich sein."}

Ebenso gibt es keine Hinweise darauf, dass vorausgehende Bestrahlung einen Risikofaktor darstellt. Selten treten Leiomyosarkome im Rahmen eines heredit\u00e4ren Retinoblastoms auf, auch finden sich bei wenigen Tumoren Ver\u00e4nderungen im RB-Tumorsuppressorgen. Aufgrund der unspezifischen Symptome ist die Diagnose meist ein Zufallsbefund, wenn aus anderen Gr\u00fcnden eine Operation notwendig war. Das Leiomyosarkom ist im Operationspr\u00e4parat normalerweise nicht vom Leiomyom zu unterscheiden, gegebenenfalls auftretende Nekrosen k\u00f6nnen einen Hinweis auf die Dignit\u00e4t liefern. Weiterhin sind Infiltrationen in das umliegende Gewebe wie z. B. bei Lokalisation in der Geb\u00e4rmutter in das Myometrium, Endometrium oder Parametrium malignomverd\u00e4chtig. In der Histologie finden sich vielgestaltige Zellkerne und Riesenzellen. Das relevanteste Kriterium f\u00fcr die Diagnose des Leiomyosarkoms bleibt der Mitosereichtum (mehr als 10 Mitosen in 10 Gesichtsfeldern bei 400facher Vergr\u00f6\u00dferung) und gleichzeitig vorkommender Vielgestaltigkeit der Zellen (Zellpolymorphie)."}

Das atypische HUS hat seine Ursache in Knochenmarkstransplantationen oder immunsuppressiver Medikation nach Transplantationen, bei Schwangerschaft, Krebs, Chemotherapie und HIV.

Als bakterielle Infektionskrankheit wird hingegen die direkte Sch\u00e4digung des Wirtes durch den Erreger und die darauf folgenden Abwehrreaktionen des Wirtes bei einer Infektion definiert. Eine krankhafte, selbstsch\u00e4digende Abwehrreaktionen des Wirtes nach einer bakteriellen Infektion, also nach der Elimination des Erregers, wird nicht als bakterielle Infektionskrankheit angesprochen, obwohl die Ursache in der urspr\u00fcnglichen Infektion liegt. Diese Folgeerkrankungen bezeichnet man als post- oder parainfekti\u00f6se Syndrome. Vermehrt sich das Bakterium, dringt jedoch wie beispielsweise bei den meisten Bakterien auf der Haut oder in der Mundh\u00f6hle nicht in das Gewebe ein, so spricht man von bakterieller Besiedelung. Dies gilt auch f\u00fcr Bakterien, die als Kommensalen oder Symbionten im Magen-Darm-Trakt als sogenannte Darmflora vorkommen, da der Magen-Darm-Trakt anatomisch als \u201eau\u00dfen\u201c betrachtet wird. Gelangen bei einer solchen Besiedelung sch\u00e4digende bakterielle Stoffwechselprodukte (Exotoxine) in den Wirt, so ist dies eine bakterielle Intoxikation. Umgangssprachlich werden akute bakterielle Infektionskrankheiten der Atemwege auch verk\u00fcrzt als bakterielle Infekte bezeichnet. Eine Infektionskrankheit entsteht durch die krankheitsausl\u00f6senden Eigenschaften eines Erregers und den Reaktionen des Wirtes auf das Eindringen und Vermehren des Erregers. Dabei verursacht ein Erreger nicht in jedem Fall eine Erkrankung, vielmehr sind Verlauf und Symptome einer bakteriellen Infektionskrankheit das Ergebnis eines sehr komplexen und dynamischen Zusammenspiels zwischen Wirt und Erreger. Im Verlauf der Jahrmillionen andauernden Koevolution von beiden entwickelten Wirtsorganismen immer spezifischere Abwehrmechanismen, beginnend mit der einfachen Phagozytose des Erregers (Aufnahme in die Zelle und Zerst\u00f6rung durch intrazellul\u00e4ren Verdau), mechanische und enzymatische Barrieren, Entwicklung eines unspezifischen Abwehrsystems mithilfe von Plasmaproteinen (Komplementsystem), bis hin zum spezifischen zellul\u00e4ren System der T-Lymphozyten und nicht-zellul\u00e4rer (humoraler), spezifischer Antik\u00f6rper. Die bakteriellen Erreger ihrerseits entwickelten immer neue molekulare und biochemische Mechanismen, um diese einzelnen Abwehrbarrieren zu unterlaufen. Aufgrund der sehr kurzen Generationszeit von Bakterien im Vergleich zu den Wirtsorganismen (20 Minuten bis wenige Stunden im Vergleich zu mehreren Jahren), k\u00f6nnen bakterielle Erreger sehr viel schneller Varianten hervorbringen und auf neue Abwehrmechanismen reagieren.

Dies ist aber lediglich in einigen Presseberichten so zu finden. Die aktuellste Studie (2017) zu dem Thema Cannabis und Erbrechen, die sich unter anderem damit besch\u00e4ftigt, ob das Cannabis-Hyperemesis-Syndrom \u00fcberhaupt tats\u00e4chlich existiert, berichtet, dass von den untersuchten Patienten mit Marihuanakonsum und Erbrechenssymptomen kein einziger diese Symptome mit hei\u00dfem Baden oder Duschen bek\u00e4mpfen w\u00fcrde. Der Pathomechanismus ist bisher nicht gekl\u00e4rt. Das Syndrom tritt angeblich durch einen jahrelangen, t\u00e4glichen, und vergleichsweise hohen Cannabiskonsum auf. Jedoch sind die Symptome praktisch identisch zu denen des viel h\u00e4ufiger vorkommenden Syndroms des zyklischen Erbrechens. In der hyperemetischen Phase werden Antiemetika gegeben, sowie auf eine ausreichende Fl\u00fcssigkeitszufuhr \u2013 allenfalls mit Infusionen \u2013 geachtet. Sollte das Cannabinoid-Hyperemesis-Syndrom tats\u00e4chlich durch Cannabiskonsum hervorgerufen werden, liegt die Empfehlung nahe, durch den v\u00f6lligen Verzicht auf Cannabis die Wahrscheinlichkeit eines Wiederauftretens des Syndroms zu mindern."}

Das Marburgvirus ist damit eng verwandt mit den Ebola-Viren und den Cuevaviren, zu denen das erstmals 2011 in Nordspanien nachgewiesene Lloviu-Virus z\u00e4hlt. Das Reservoir, aus dem das Virus stammt, ist bis heute nicht zweifelsfrei bestimmt. Vermutlich ist der \u00dcbertr\u00e4ger der Nilflughund, eine Fledermausart, die in Europa und Afrika vorkommt. Die Theorie, dass Fledertiere das nat\u00fcrliche Reservoir von Filoviren darstellen, wird unter anderem durch das geh\u00e4ufte Auftreten von Marburgfieber in Folge eines H\u00f6hlenbesuches gest\u00fctzt. So waren in Durba (Kongo, 1998\u20132000) 53 % (75/142) aller Infizierten Minenarbeiter in h\u00e4ufigem Kontakt zu Fledertieren. Das Virus stammt vermutlich aus Zentralafrika. Sehr wahrscheinlich wurde es 1967 mit Versuchsaffen (Meerkatzen) aus Uganda in die Laboratorien des Pharmakonzerns Behringwerke im hessischen Marburg eingeschleppt. Die Folgeerkrankung, das Marburgfieber, trat zuerst bei den dort besch\u00e4ftigten Laboranten auf, und das Virus wurde anschlie\u00dfend in der Tropenklinik von Marburg zum ersten Mal identifiziert. Daher hat es den Namen Marburgvirus erhalten. Das Fieber trat sp\u00e4ter auch in Frankfurt am Main und in Belgrad auf. Von den damals 31 Erkrankten starben sieben. Das Marburgvirus wird haupts\u00e4chlich durch den Kontakt mit K\u00f6rperfl\u00fcssigkeiten (Blut, Stuhl, Urin, Speichel, Muttermilch usw. ) \u00fcbertragen."}

Hilfreich bei der differentialdiagnostischen Abgrenzung vom adenoid-zystischen Karzinom ist die Expression der Marker Ki-67 und p53.
