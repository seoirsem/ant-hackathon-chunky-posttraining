There is evidence of human settlement on the northern coastline of Bahrain dating back to the Bronze Age. The Dilmun civilisation inhabited the area in 3000 BC, serving as a key regional trading hub between Mesopotamia, Magan and the Indus Valley civilisation. Approximately 100,000 Dilmun burial mounds were found across the north and central regions of the country, some originating 5,000 years ago. Despite the discovery of the mounds, there is no significant evidence to suggest heavy urbanisation took place during the Dilmun era. It is believed that the majority of the population lived in rural areas, numbering several thousands.

This was followed by Babylonian and Achaemenid rule, which later gave way to Greek influence during the time of Alexander the Great's conquests. In the first century AD, the Roman writer Pliny the Elder wrote of Tylos, the Hellenic name of Bahrain in the classical era, and its pearls and cotton fields. The island came under the control of the Parthian and Sassanid empires respectively, by which time Nestorian Christianity started to spread in Bahrain. By 410-420 AD, a Nestorian bishopric and monastery was established in Al Dair, on the neighbouring island of Muharraq. Following the conversion of Bahrain to Islam in 628 AD, work on one of the earliest mosques in the region, the Khamis Mosque, began as early as the seventh century AD."}

Later referred to as the Convent of Santa Clara, the construction of the monastery developed from a dream; the nobleman presumably had a dream of constructing a stairway to heaven, which he was convinced was a sign from God that He wanted him to construct a house of worship, and stopped his planned construction of a castle. The cornerstone was laid in 1318, and once completed it was deposited in the hands of the Franciscan Order, which he patronanized throughout his life, eventually leaving Vila do Conde, its lands and rents, in their possession after his and his wife's deaths.

In 1967, the Earlington Yellowjackets won the state \"Sweet 16\" basketball tournament. During the 1960s, the champions of the Sweet 16 were typically from Jefferson County (Louisville) or Fayette County (Lexington), among the largest population centers in the state. Earlington remains one of the smallest schools to ever win the \"Sweet 16\" in the modern era. When the city school board decided to merge with the Hopkins County School System, the school and community were split into two. Half of the student population was enrolled at South Hopkins High School approximately to the south, and half at West Hopkins High School, located approximately to the west. The areas were divided by the railroad line that bisects the town. Earlington also had a private school that operated until the 1970s. Immaculate Conception, the only Roman Catholic parish in Earlington and the oldest parish in Hopkins County, operated a school periodically from the 1890s until the school was condemned in the 1970s due to poor building conditions. The school served students in kindergarten through sixth grade. Located across the street from the parish building, it was demolished after the school closed."}

The Ambari excavations trace the city to the Hindu kingdoms of Shunga-Kushana period of Indian history, between the 2nd century BC and the 1st century AD. During earlier periods of the city's history it was known as Pragjyotishpura, and was the capital of Assam under the Varman Dynasty of the Kamarupa kingdom. Descriptions by Xuanzang (Hiuen Tsang) reveal that during the reign of the Varman king Bhaskaravarman (7th century AD), the city stretched for about 30 li ( ). It remained as the capital of Assam until the 10th-11th century AD under the rule of the Pala dynasty. Archaeological evidence by excavations in Ambari, and excavated brick walls and houses discovered during construction of the present Cotton College's auditorium suggest the city was of economic and strategic importance until the 9th-11th century AD. The city was the seat of the Borphukan, the civil military authority of the Lower Assam region appointed by the Ahom kings. The Borphukan's residence was in the present Fancy Bazar area, and his council-hall, called Dopdar, was about to the west of the Bharalu stream. The Majindar Baruah, the personal secretary of the Borphukan, had his residence in the present-day deputy commissioner's residence."}

After only a year the town had grown from 15 homes to 50. As new amenities were added to the town, Nampa continued its growth and was incorporated in 1890. Unlike most towns in that historic era with streets running true north and south, Nampa's historic roads run perpendicular to the railroad tracks that travel northwest to southeast through the town. Thus, the northside is really the northeast side of the tracks, and the southside is really the southwest side of the railroad tracks. Founder Alexander Duffes laid out Nampa's streets this way to prevent an accident like one that occurred earlier in a town he had platted near Toronto, Canada. In that town, a woman and her two children were killed by a train when they started across the railroad tracks in a buggy and the wheel got stuck. As the Oregon Short Line railroad originally bypassed Boise, Nampa has the fanciest of many railroad depots built in the area. The first elementary school was built in the 1890s. Lakeview School was located on a hill on 6th Street and 12th Avenue North, with a view of Lake Ethel. Just after the school's centennial celebration, it was condemned as a school and sold to the First Mennonite Church."}

The remains of several buildings are still visible within the nature area. The quarried stone was cut into building stones and paving blocks and shipped to construction projects throughout the country. The pink quartzite was superior in quality to other stones and possessed a coloring which was extremely delicate and pleasing to the eye. The stone was used in the construction of several Sioux Falls buildings including the Old Courthouse Museum, old post office (now the Federal Courthouse), Carnegie public library, and Pettigrew Home & Museum. Historical records show that hundreds of miles of roads in the larger cities of the west were paved with quartzite blocks cut at the East Sioux Falls quarries."}

What was most important to the local religious community was to keep prohibition for the betterment of the social order of Monmouth. Although opponents raised religious, moral, economic, and quality-of-life arguments similar to those preached during the nineteenth century, they also brought two new arguments to center stage: the historic nature of Monmouth's prohibition and the uniqueness that local prohibition brought to the town. Eventually support for the prohibition ordinance started to wear thin throughout the community of Monmouth. Although die-hard supporters of prohibition continued to fight the inevitable, there were signs that it was starting to become more and more detrimental to the social and economic aspects of the community.

Besides bordering the bay, the city encompasses marshes through which runoff from inland fields drain to the bay. The piece of land was purchased by Seabrook W. Sydnor in 1895. In March 1903, the Seabrook Company of Houston created a layout of the proposed Seabrook Town site. The new town attracted fishermen, merchants and even a few residents. The Galveston Hurricane of 1900 demolished the local school, but by 1905 it was restored and was run by three teachers who taught 100 students.

It could handle 150 boats, and opened up jobs and is the main cause of the population increase. Despite damage from Hurricane Carla, a bridge linking Seabrook and Kemah was completed in 1961. With the opening of the bridge and the Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Seabrook's population rose to approximately 6,000. In 1986, the decision was made to start the construction of a fixed-span bridge that was tall enough for sailboats to pass under. After this bridge was finished, Highway 146 was linked all the way from Galveston to Texas State Highway 225."}

Mendoza suffered a severe earthquake in 1861 that killed at least 5,000 people. The city was rebuilt, incorporating innovative urban designs that would better tolerate such seismic activity. Mendoza was rebuilt with large squares and wider streets and sidewalks than any other city in Argentina. Avenue Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre and additional small squares are examples of that design. Tourism, wine production, and more recently the exploitation of hard commodities such as oil and uranium ensure Mendoza's status as a key regional center."}

In fact the logical place to assemble 800 or so ships was in the large lagoon (where now there is farmland and a maze of drainage ditches) behind a coastal fringe of islands (where the modern ports of Calais and Dunkirk now sit) because in Caesar's day an estuary stretched all the way inland to the site of modern St Omer. Albert Grenier explained this (in French) in 1944 soon after D-day when the practicalities of large invasions across the Channel were fresh in mind. Careful analysis of Caesar's text versus modern understanding of wind, weather, tides, and siltation makes it almost certain that this was Caesar's departure port. Boulogne, Wissant, and Quentovic later became important as ports for small numbers of ships. The English side of the Channel also has many places that were Roman-era ports but are now far inland."}

This period was characterized by exploitation of the ecosystem in the Sado Estuary, when the river extended to S\u00e3o Rom\u00e3o, involving fishing, scavenging for shellfish, hunting and foraging in the local forests. The primitive tools, made from chert, were adapted from the techniques of the late Paleolithic era. By the late Mesolithic period, people had concentrated in the area of Comporta and Torr\u00e3o, later establishing primitive defensive protection to support its communities. These principal settlements were abandoned by the Copper Age, but repopulated during the Iron Age, as was the case of Alc\u00e1cer. Mediterranean trade, pioneered by the Phoenicians, introduced commercial colonies in Abul and Alc\u00e1cer (then referred to as Bevipo or Keition), where a written alphabet and currency allowed commerce to flourish. After the Third Punic War, with the fall of Carthage, Alc\u00e1cer was annexed to the Roman Empire (around 1st-2nd century B. C. ). The municipality of present Alc\u00e1cer became known as Urbs Imperatoria Salacia in honor of the sea god Neptune's wife, nymph Salacia, for its importance in the Iberian salt trade and the number of routes that crossed the area. Salatia suffered many of the problems that developed from the Roman urbes localized between Atlantic routes and Romanized northern Europe, and was made incrementally worse by Emperor Claudius's initiatives into England and Wales. These problems changed during the 3rd Century, when the port of Salatia was devalued, in favor of Olisipo (Lisbon). With the rise of Gaul, most of Hispania became a vassal state of the larger empire. Returning to the Imperial fold with the 296AD reorganization of Roman territories by Diocletian (in order to subvert the Military Anarchy that existed at the time), Salatia's role was transformed."}

Probably at about this time, Qatif became the main port for the mainland surpassing 'Uqair in importance for the trade and thus became the capital of the Usfurids.

A significant portion of the inhabitants descend from the Arab bedouin tribe of Banu Hilal, others are mainly Chaoui Berbers. In 1844, Biskra became a French garrison. As of 1935, Biskra was an inland town, the principal settlement of a Saharan oasis watered by the intermittent Oued Biskra. In 1911, it was described as the Nice of Algiers. It is in the southern part of the Algerian rail system, and a favourite winter resort. Large quantities of fruit, especially dates and olives, were grown in the vicinity. The town was a military post, and was the scene of severe fighting in the rebellions of 1849 and 1871. The inhabitants are also Ouled Na\u00efl or Chaamba living in Biskra, M'Sila and in Saharan Atlas. Biskra is the setting of key sections of Andr\u00e9 Gide's 1902 novel The Immoralist and lesser known 1897 prose-poem Les nourritures terrestres (The Fruits of the Earth), and he visited the town in 1895 (for a fortnight from 31 January) with Lord Alfred Douglas, following a meeting with Oscar Wilde in Blida and Algiers. The Hungarian composer B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k collected traditional music in Biskra in 1913."}

The cruiser was transporting German soldiers and bureaucrats for the planned swift occupation of Oslo, but the Battle of Dr\u00f8bak Sound resulting in the sinking by the Oscarsborg fortress delayed this, and thus allowed for the evacuation of the Norwegian Royal Family, parliament, and cabinet, and for the nation's gold reserves to be denied the occupiers.

In 1895, the Hemet Dam was completed on the San Jacinto River, creating Lake Hemet and providing a reliable water supply to the San Jacinto Valley. This water system was a major contribution to the valley's development as an agricultural area. By 1894, the area had a newspaper, the Hemet News, and \"several general stores,\" the largest being Heffelfinger & Co, which occupied an entire block. There were \"a drug store, an excellent barber shop, two blacksmith shops, harness shop, shoe repairing houses, two real estate offices and two lumber yards. \" \"The most pretentious building\" was the two-story Hotel Mayberry, \"supplied with all the modern conveniences usually found in first-class hostelries, including stationary water, baths, etc."}

Phuntsholing is uniquely more urban than other Bhutanese towns as it is the Bhutan financial, industrial and trading capital. It has been affected a little by the neighbouring culture, but is distinctly far more quiet and orderly than its neighbour.

The co-existence of different cultures is reflected in Tudela's reputation for producing important medieval writers such as Al-Tutili. In 1157 the English scholar Robert of Ketton, first translator of the Koran to a Western tongue (Latin), became a canon of Tudela. The Jews were banished in 1498 (the expulsion from Navarre occurring slightly later than in the rest of Spain). Muslims and Moriscos were expelled in 1516 and 1610 respectively."}

He initially placed the port town at Rapaki and the settlement's capital, Christchurch, and the head of the harbour at present-day Teddington. But none of these initial ideas proved feasible, as Rapaki was not available, as it had been promised to Maori as a reserve, and required reclamation at the head of the harbour for the capital was estimated as too expensive. Early survey work in Lyttelton was done by Thomas and Charles Torlesse, but most of it until completion in September 1849 was done by Edward Jollie."}

Later, pre-Inca cultures domesticated llamas and became sedentary with the development of agriculture. During this time, major irrigation channels were built within the valley of the Chili river, which allowed the development of agriculture by means of terraces built on both sides of the valley. The Yarabaya and Chimbe tribes settled in the city's current location, and together with the Cabana and Collagua tribes they developed an agrarian economy in the valley. When the Inca Mayta Capac arrived in the valley of the Chili river, he didn't build cities; instead, he gave orders to his mitimae (settlers from lands within the Inca empire) to settle in the valley to gain control of the existing population, perform intelligence tasks and strengthen border enclaves as a way to control the unconquered villages.

Prior to its current location in Crown Point, Indiana, the county seat was located on what is now the west end of Lake Station in a section called Liverpool, although it was a separate settlement at the time. The name of Lake Station was officially changed to East Gary in 1908 in an attempt to lure executives from the nearby US Steel plant in Gary, Indiana into creating a suburban community. With another name change in 1977, primarily to disassociate itself from the urban decay and crime of Gary, the city reverted to its historical designation of Lake Station. Lake Station also plays host to some events such as the Fuzz Follies, which is a car show that takes place in Riverview Park every year since 1984. Since 2004 The Heritage Days Festival has also taken place in Riverview Park. Both events are usually in June."}

In the early 13th century, Duke Casimir I of Opole decided to move the settlement from the Pasieka Island into the right shore of the Oder river (since the 17th century it is the old stream bed of Oder known as M\u0142yn\u00f3wka). All of the inhabitants had to be moved in order to make place for the castle that was eventually built in the place of the old city. Former inhabitants of Ostr\u00f3wek together with German merchants that immigrated here from the West, received first town rights probably as early as around, 1217 though this date is disputed. Opole received German town law in 1254, which was expanded with Neumarkt law in 1327."}

The town was the southern terminus for the Proprietors of the Susquehanna Canal and later the Susquehanna and Tidewater Canal, which bypassed difficult navigational areas of the lower Susquehanna River between Havre de Grace and Wrightsville, Pennsylvania, where it connected to the Pennsylvania Canal. It was built between 1836\u20131840, but operations on the canal declined after 1855 because of competition from railroads, which could carry freight more quickly. The Lock Keeper's house and remnants of the canal exist today as a museum. Havre de Grace was a primary town on the Eastern Route of the Underground Railroad in Maryland, as slaves could cross the Susquehanna to havens in the free state of Pennsylvania, traveling on to Philadelphia and New York."}

A statue of Ovid stands in the Ovid Square (Pia\u021ba Ovidiu) of Constan\u021ba, in front of the History Museum (the former City Hall). A number of inscriptions found in the city and its vicinity show that Constan\u021ba lies where Tomis once stood. Some of these are now preserved in the British Museum in London. The city was afterwards included in the Province of Moesia, and, from the time of Diocletian, in Scythia Minor, of which it was the metropolis. After the 5th century, Tomis fell under the rule of the Eastern Roman Empire. During Maurice's Balkan campaigns, Tomis was besieged by the Avars in the winter of 597/598. Tomis was later renamed to Constantiana in honour of Constantia, the half-sister of Roman Emperor Constantine the Great (274-337). The earliest known usage of this name was \"\u039a\u03c9\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1\" (\"Constantia\") in 950. The city lay at the seaward end of the Great Wall of Trajan, and has evidently been surrounded by fortifications of its own. After successively becoming part of the Bulgarian Empire for over 500 years, and later of the independent principality of Dobrotitsa/Dobrotici and of Wallachia under Mircea I of Wallachia, Constan\u021ba fell under the Ottoman rule around 1419."}

Antrim provides the following theory: \"It is said by some that Mr. Ward named the town from the word Urbanity, but I think it is quite likely he named it from an old Roman custom of dividing their people into different classes \u2013 one class, the Plebeians, and this again divided into two classes \u2013 Plebs Rustica and Plebs Urbana.

There are mostly narrow streets, various squares (including the Plaza de Col\u00f3n, with a bronze statue of Columbus given to the city by Queen Isabella II. and erected in 1862) and substantial and elegant business and public buildings, including the ornate parish church designed by Architect Rafael Carrer\u00e1, who also built the famous Palacio Aldama in Central Havana. The city is divided into the barrios of Cantel, Fundici\u00f3n, Gu\u00e1simas, Marina, M\u00e9ndez Capote, Pueblo Nuevo and Versalles. The world-famous beach resort of \"Varadero\" is part of the Municipality of C\u00e1rdenas. C\u00e1rdenas was founded in 1828, with the help of several old aristocratic Spanish-Cuban families from the nearby provincial capital of Matanzas and in 1861 already had 12,910 inhabitants. The completion of the railroad in 1841 led to further development. C\u00e1rdenas was one of the first cities in Cuba to have electric service, public transportation (trams), telegraph and telephone. The city was peculiar in not being laid out in the traditional central-plaza Spanish custom, but rather, inspired on a North American perpendicular grid pattern, modeled on the city of Charleston, South Carolina, with the help of American (Confederate) landscape engineers. In 1850, the Venezuelan General Narciso L\u00f3pez, along with some Americans and Cuban exiles, landed here on a filibustering expedition, and held the town for a few hours, abandoning it when he saw that the people would not rise to support him in his efforts to secure Cuban independence. L\u00f3pez did, however, raise for first time the modern Flag of Cuba designed by him along with a local Cuban Miguel Teurbe Tolon."}

With the LL&G Railroad set to arrive shortly thereafter, the early residents of the towns of Tioga, Chicago Junction, Alliance, and New Chicago needed an innovative solution to an escalating dispute over which town would claim the right to house the LL&G Railroad's new land office. The towns were unable to settle their differences until an individual by the name of Octave Chanute came to town. Octave was the Chief Engineer and General Superintendent of the LL&G Railroad. In 1872, he suggested the towns merge to end the bickering. On January 1, 1873 the towns merged and became chartered as the City of Chanute. With the Southern Kansas Railroad locating a division headquarters in Chanute, the city began to flourish. In 1887, Chanute boasted a rapid growth in flourmills, grain elevators, banks, drug and hardware stores, and natural gas. In 1903, the City of Chanute established the electric utility, and in the years to follow, established the gas, water, wastewater,refuse utilities. Ash Grove Cement Company, the sixth largest cement manufacturer in North America, and the largest US-owned cement company, commenced cement manufacture in 1908 in Chanute. In September 2011 Spirit AeroSystems announced the expansion of an assembly facility which will grow to 150 employees in five years and boost the local economy. Chanute is one of only a handful of remaining full-service cities in the State of Kansas."}

Local economic activity revolves around the remittance economy generated by massive outmigration to Spain and Italy during the early 2000s, although the largest industrial employers in textiles and chemicals have been rejuvenated by EU membership. N\u0103s\u0103ud still has a few late 18th and early 19th century buildings left standing. Most remarkable in this regard is the local Romanian Greek Catholic church and the former military headquarters of the Habsburg era military regiment, now a museum. Although the town hall is located in its midst, the 19th century center of the town has been left to decay. Since 2012 the municipality has begun to restore the buildings in the old city center. The town hall saw a complete restoration and expansion in 2013. The economic upturn of the mid-2000s has translated into a better city life and infrastructure improvements. Most notable in this regard are the refurbishing of the old military headquarters (now a museum), improved roads and more bar/restaurant options. Two new restaurants (Geea and La Borsanu) are popular in town."}

In the 19th century the building of a railway line through Zwittau contributed to the development of the town, especially the textile industry. Svitavy was historically a German-speaking town with a Czech minority; in 1930, 88. 4% of the population was German. In the beginning of the 20th century the town saw tensions between Czech and German speaking people. In October 1938, the town was added to Sudetenland and occupied by the German army. After the end of the Second World War in 1945, the German population was expelled as a result of the Bene\u0161 decrees. The industrialist Oskar Schindler, who saved 1,200 Jews working at his factory during the war, was born in Zwittau."}

Though their territory had been claimed by Spain since the early 16th century, they would have relatively little contact with Europeans until 1769, when, as part of an effort to colonize Alta California, an exploration party led by Don Gaspar de Portol\u00e1 learned of the existence of San Francisco Bay. Seven years later, in 1776, an expedition led by Juan Bautista de Anza selected the site for the Presidio of San Francisco, which Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Moraga would soon establish. Later the same year, the Franciscan missionary Francisco Pal\u00f3u founded the Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds (Mission Dolores). As part of the founding, the priests claimed the land south of the mission for sixteen miles for raising crops and for fodder for cattle and sheep. In 1778, the priests and soldiers marked out a trail to connect San Francisco to the rest of California. At the top of Mission Hill, the priests named the gap between San Bruno Mountain and the hills on the coast La Portezuela (\"The Little Door\"). La Portezuela was later referred to as Daly's Hill, the Center of Daly City, and is now called Top of the Hill. During Spanish rule, the area between San Bruno Mountain and the Pacific remained uninhabited. Upon independence from Spain, prominent Mexican citizens were granted land parcels to establish large ranches, three of which covered areas now in Daly City and Colma. Rancho Buri Buri was granted to Jose Sanchez in 1835 and covered including parts of modern-day Colma, Burlingame, San Bruno, South San Francisco, and Millbrae. Rancho Laguna de la Merced was acres and covered the area around a lake of the same name.

Kindliche Hypoglyk\u00e4mien nach der Entbindung stellen die quantitativ bedeutsamste Komplikation nach einer m\u00fctterlichen diabetischen Stoffwechsellage in der Schwangerschaft dar. Als Ursache eines erniedrigten N\u00fcchternblutzuckers gelten das Insulinom, allgemein der Hyperinsulinismus, schwere Lebererkrankungen, bei denen die Gluconeogenese oder die Freisetzung von Glukose ins Blut (Glykogenspeicherkrankheit) eingeschr\u00e4nkt ist, die Ur\u00e4mie, die mit einer Insuffizienz von Nebennierenrinde oder Hypophysenvorderlappen verbundene Minderung blutzuckersteigernder Hormone, die Zuckerausscheidung \u00fcber die Niere und Tumoren wie beispielsweise das Leberzellkarzinom. Auch die Ausscheidung insulin\u00e4hnlicher Peptide im Rahmen einer Paraneoplasie und Glykogenosen k\u00f6nnen daf\u00fcr verantwortlich sein. Auch bereits bei Neugeborenen, deren M\u00fctter Diabetikerinnen sind, oder bei Kindern mit einer angeborenen Hyperplasie der Inselzellen der Bauchspeicheldr\u00fcse kann ein erniedrigter N\u00fcchternblutzucker auftreten. Typische \u00e4u\u00dfere Ursachen f\u00fcr eine Hypoglyk\u00e4mie sind eine \u00fcberh\u00f6hte Dosis von Insulin oder von Sulfonylharnstoffen sowie ein \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfiger Alkoholkonsum ohne gleichzeitige Nahrungsaufnahme."}

Nachdem die Zoospore ein Krebstier erreichte, wirft sie die beiden Gei\u00dfeln ab und bildet auf der Oberfl\u00e4che des Wirtes eine Zyste.

Darin ist weniger die Matrix aus Chitin und Calciumcarbonat hemmend als vielmehr die nicht-chitinigen Proteolipide (Komplexe aus Proteinen und Lipiden) der Epicuticula, die eine hydrophobe Umh\u00fcllung darstellt. Falls das Eindringen missgl\u00fcckt, betr\u00e4gt die Lebenserwartung einer Zoospore ohne Nahrungsaufnahme aus dem Wirt etwa f\u00fcnf Tage und der Vorgang des Gei\u00dfelabwurfes ist durch Neubildung bis zu dreimal m\u00f6glich.

Auch die Beine k\u00f6nnen betroffen sein, in schweren F\u00e4llen sogar der ganze K\u00f6rper. Typische Symptome sind Kribbeln, Taubheit oder Schw\u00e4che in den Beinen. Manchmal treten Muskelkr\u00e4mpfe oder St\u00f6rungen im Blasen- und Darmbereich auf. Warum es dazu kommt, ist nach wie vor nicht hinreichend gekl\u00e4rt. Um eine bessere Vorstellung von diesem Leiden zu bekommen, lohnt ein Blick auf die Anatomie: Die Wirbels\u00e4ule besteht aus 24 Wirbelk\u00f6rpern mit ihren 23 dazwischen liegenden Bandscheiben. Durch den Wirbelkanal l\u00e4uft der etwa fingerdicke R\u00fcckenmarksstrang vom Sch\u00e4del bis zum Lendenwirbel. Und durch diesen wiederum l\u00e4uft ein Schlauch \u2013 die Dura mater \u2013 in der sich die R\u00fcckenmarksfl\u00fcssigkeit \u2013 der Liquor cerebrospinalis \u2013 befindet, die wie eine Gleitfl\u00fcssigkeit wirkt. Sie h\u00e4lt die Wirbel geschmeidig, damit wir unseren K\u00f6rper bei allt\u00e4glichen Arbeiten beugen und drehen k\u00f6nnen. Au\u00dferdem befindet sich in der Dura mater aber auch die Spinnengewebshaut, die Experten als Arachnoidea bezeichnen. Wenn sich der Liquor im R\u00fcckenmarkskanal staut, entsteht ein Druck, der schlie\u00dflich so gro\u00df wird, dass sich die Fl\u00fcssigkeit einen Weg rechts und links der Wirbels\u00e4ule bahnt. Das sieht dann so aus wie ein Spinnengewebe. Als Folge kommt es zur Arachnopathie, einer Entz\u00fcndung, die schlie\u00dflich sogar zu einer Narbenbildung f\u00fchrt und die Bewegungsm\u00f6glichkeiten stark eingeschr\u00e4nkt.

Sie wiesen die typischen Symptome am Skelett einer Frau nach, die vor rund 2550 Jahren bei Tauberbischofsheim im Alter von 18 bis 20 Jahren verstorben war. Erstmals als Krankheitsbild erw\u00e4hnt wurde das Down-Syndrom 1838 von dem Psychiater Jean \u00c9tienne Esquirol und 1846 sowie 1866 ausf\u00fchrlicher von dem Arzt und P\u00e4dagogen \u00c9douard S\u00e9guin beschrieben. Der englische Neurologe und Apotheker John Langdon-Down beschrieb das nach ihm benannte Down-Syndrom 1866 zum ersten Mal wissenschaftlich als eigenst\u00e4ndiges, von anderen Erkrankungen und Behinderungen abgrenzbares Syndrom. Langdon-Down selbst bezeichnete es als mongoloide Idiotie und pr\u00e4gte damit die Begriffe des Mongolismus und Mongoloide als Bezeichnung f\u00fcr seine Tr\u00e4ger aufgrund ihrer rundlichen Gesichtsform und mandelf\u00f6rmigen Augen, was zu einer gewissen \u00c4hnlichkeit mit Mongolen f\u00fchrt (der Begriff lehnt sich an die damals popul\u00e4re Systematik einer mongoliden Rasse an, die nach Johann Friedrich Blumenbach an der Sch\u00e4delform unterschieden werden k\u00f6nne).

Erst 1959, 63 Jahre nach Langdon-Downs Tod, erkannte eine Gruppe franz\u00f6sischer Wissenschaftler, darunter J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lejeune und Marthe Gautier, die genetische Ursache des Syndroms: Sie entdeckten, dass jede Zelle der betroffenen Menschen 47 statt der \u00fcblichen 46 Chromosomen besa\u00df, also bei einem Chromosom eine Verdreifachung (Trisomie) statt einer Verdoppelung vorliegen musste. Sie konnten noch nicht feststellen, welches Chromosom verdreifacht war. Erst sp\u00e4ter wurde der Nachweis gef\u00fchrt, dass das 21. Chromosom betroffen ist (Trisomie 21). Bei zwei Schimpansen \u2013 deren Chromosom 22 dem Chromosom 21 des Menschen entspricht \u2013 wurde festgestellt, dass sie aufgrund einer Trisomie 22 \u00e4hnliche Symptome entwickelten wie Menschen mit einer Trisomie 21."}

Innerhalb weniger Tage klingen die Beschwerden wieder ab. Bei der chronischen Form stehen oft nur die Symptome Husten und Atembeschwerden im Mittelpunkt, die \u00fcber Monate bis Jahre anhalten. Urs\u00e4chlich wirken sensibilisierende organische Materialien vor allem aus Sporen von thermophilen Actinomyceten, Aspergillen und anderen Schimmelpilzen, ferner Bestandteile von Vogelfedern und Proteine von Insekten und Schalentieren. Mit der Entdeckung weiterer gef\u00e4hrdender St\u00e4ube muss gerechnet werden. Intensivem Kontakt ist man besonders bei der Haltung von V\u00f6geln (Kot und Staub) und der Arbeit mit verschimmeltem und anschlie\u00dfend getrocknetem Heu ausgesetzt. Als Allergene f\u00fchren die eingeatmeten Schimmelbestandteile zu einer Entz\u00fcndung der Lungenbl\u00e4schen und des dazwischen liegenden Bindegewebes, die durch eine Immunkomplexreaktion (\u00fcberwiegend Typ III) ausgel\u00f6st wird. Wichtigste Differentialdiagnose ist das Drescherfieber (ODTS, organic dust toxic syndrome), das durch Endotoxine als Bestandteil der Zellwand gram-negativer Bakterien verursacht wird. Das Drescherfieber ist nicht allergisch bedingt und kann daher bereits bei Erstkontakt auftreten. Die akute Form heilt meist folgenlos ab. Bei der chronischen Form kann es unbehandelt und gelegentlich auch trotz Behandlung und Allergenkarenz zu einer Vernarbung des Lungengewebes (Lungenfibrose) kommen. Dies kann zu Atembeschwerden (respiratorische Insuffizienz) und zu einer Erh\u00f6hung des Blutdrucks im kleinen Kreislauf mit nachfolgender Rechtsherzbelastung f\u00fchren (Cor pulmonale)."}

Aufgrund der Gemeinsamkeit der Ablagerung von Amyloid wurde die CAA urspr\u00fcnglich als ein Merkmal der Alzheimer-Krankheit gesehen. In den 1970er Jahren konnte man zeigen, dass bei vielen intrazerebralen Blutungen, die nicht auf zu hohen Blutdruck zur\u00fcckzuf\u00fchren sind, derartig ver\u00e4nderte Gef\u00e4\u00dfw\u00e4nde eine Rolle spielen. Die h\u00e4ufigste Form ist die Beta-Amyloid-Ablagerung, die in bis zu 80 % der Alzheimer-Krankheitsf\u00e4lle beobachtet wird. Daneben existieren verschiedene erbliche Formen mit Mutationen des Amyloid-Precursor-Proteins (Dutch type), Presenilin, Cystatin-C-Mutation (ACys, Icelandic type) sowie die heredit\u00e4re Demenz vom britischen/d\u00e4nischen Typ. Beta-Amyloid entsteht durch Zerschneiden des Amyloid-Precursor-Proteins (APP) mithilfe der Enzyme Beta- und Gamma-Sekretase. Im normalen Stoffwechsel werden diese Peptide nicht erzeugt, man nimmt an, dass das Amyloid vorwiegend in Nervenzellen erzeugt wird. Bei Betroffenen reichert es sich im Nervenwasser an und kann sich im Gehirngewebe als sogenannte senile Plaques ablagern, wie etwa bei Alzheimer-Demenz, oder aber in den Gef\u00e4\u00dfw\u00e4nden, wie bei der CAA. Dabei wird Amyloid vor allem in der mittleren Gef\u00e4\u00dfwandschicht (Media) eingelagert.

Die Anf\u00e4lle sind oft sehr stark, aber nur kurz und enden, sobald das Kind aufh\u00f6rt zu essen, der Blick gewendet wird oder ihm wieder warm ist. Der Neurotoxikologe Peter Spencer, der die Erkrankung untersuchte, stellte fest, dass sobald den Betroffenen Essen angeboten wird, \"ein oder zwei Kinder beginnen, sehr schnell und pendelnd zu nicken [. ], einige frieren\". Besonders starke Anf\u00e4lle k\u00f6nnen zum Kollaps f\u00fchren, was zu weiteren Sch\u00e4digungen f\u00fchrt.

Die Einteilung nach Golan unterteilt das OHSS in drei verschiedene Schweregrade, welche sich an der Symptomatik orientieren Die Einteilung nach Navot wird haupts\u00e4chlich verwendet, um die schwere Form des OHSS (sOHSS) von der lebensbedrohlichen abzugrenzen Diese Einteilung unterscheidet sich von den fr\u00fcheren Schemata in einigen Aspekten. So wurde die milde Form des OHSS ausgelassen, da sie bei vielen Patientinnen w\u00e4hrend der Stimulationsphase auftritt und keine besondere Therapie erfordert. Beim sOHSS wird in drei verschiedene Arten (A, B und C) eingeteilt. In diversen Studien wurde ein Zusammenhang zwischen dem Auftreten eines OHSS und dem Lebensalter aufgezeigt. Betroffen sind meist Frauen vor dem 35. Lebensjahr. Als eine m\u00f6gliche Erkl\u00e4rung daf\u00fcr gilt die Tatsache, dass die Eierst\u00f6cke von jungen Frauen eine h\u00f6here Dichte an Gonadotropin-Rezeptoren aufweisen und demnach st\u00e4rker auf eine von au\u00dfen wirkende Gabe von Gonadotropinen reagieren.

Translokationen der Immunglobulin Schwerkette (IgH) in den chromosomalen Bereichen 4p16, 6p21, 11q13, 16q23 sowie 20q11 und eine Hyperdiploidie gelten ebenfalls als fr\u00fche Ver\u00e4nderungen, welche zur Entwicklung einer MGUS beitragen. Au\u00dferdem ist bei Personen mit Verwandten ersten Grades, bei denen eine MGUS nachgewiesen wurde, das Risiko der Entwicklung einer MGUS erh\u00f6ht.

Liegt mindestens ein Risikofaktor vor, wird eine Kontrolle nach 6 Monaten und danach j\u00e4hrlich empfohlen. Wenn die Laborkonstellation stabil scheint, kein Risikofaktor vorliegt und der Patient sonst keine Hinweise auf eine symptomatische Erkrankung zeigt, werden meist Kontrollen nach 6 Monaten und dann im Abstand von 2 bis 3 Jahren empfohlen.

Als rebellierende Selbstunterwerfung bezeichnet sie ein Ph\u00e4nomen, bei dem Widerstand gegen soziale Ausgrenzung nicht gegen dessen Verursacher gerichtet werde, sondern in Form eines S\u00fcndenbocks gegen einen unbeteiligten Dritten in Form des Anderen, des Fremden. Diese Ersatzhandlung diene letztlich der eigenen Unterwerfung unter die Zust\u00e4nde, die man zu bek\u00e4mpfen suche. In der Psychologie gilt krankhaft \u00fcbersteigerte Xenophobie als eine Form der Angstst\u00f6rung. Der Begriff Xenophobie wird auf unterschiedliche Weise gelegentlich dazu benutzt, um Rassismus und Diskriminierung als Resultat biologischer, kultureller oder \u00f6konomischer Gegebenheiten zu legitimieren: - Beispiele f\u00fcr biologisierende Erkl\u00e4rungsmodelle: Tierarten verteidigen das eigene \u201eTerritorium\u201c gegen Eindringlinge. Inwieweit es sich bei Xenophobie des Menschen um biologische Determinanten, durch Sozialisation erworbenes Verhalten beziehungsweise in engem Rahmen freie Entscheidungen handelt, ist umstritten. Was im konkreten Fall als \u201efremd\u201c wahrgenommen (und abgelehnt) wird, h\u00e4ngt nachweislich in erster Linie von historisch-kulturellen Faktoren ab. - Beispiele f\u00fcr \u00f6konomische Erkl\u00e4rungsmodelle: Fremdenfeindlichkeit tritt vermehrt in L\u00e4ndern auf, in denen die Arbeitslosenzahl steigt.

Camillo Golgi schlug 1875 vor, den Gliom-Begriff auf astrozyt\u00e4re Zellen einzugrenzen. Wesentliche Grundlagen zum heutigen Verst\u00e4ndnis von Gliomen lieferten Harvey Cushing und Percival Bailey, welche diese Tumoren aufgrund ihrer histologischen \u00c4hnlichkeiten zu Gliazellen in den 1920er Jahren definierten. James Watson Kernohan f\u00fchrte das Konzept einer biologischen Graduierung 1949 ein und unterteilte Gliome in vier m\u00f6gliche Grade. Klaus-Joachim Z\u00fclch fusionierte die Terminologie von Cushing/Bailey mit dem Graduierungskonzept von Kernohan und schuf damit die Grundlagen der heutigen WHO-Klassifikation von Gliomen. Gliome werden nach dem glialen Zelltyp, dem sie histologisch am meisten \u00e4hneln \u2013 jedoch nicht unbedingt davon abstammen \u2013 benannt.

Die Anf\u00e4nge der modernen Islamfeindlichkeit reichen jedoch weit ins 20.

Die erste umfassende Studie des Ph\u00e4nomens sowie der Versuch einer Definition stammen aus dem Jahr 1997. Benennung, Einordnung und Reichweite des Begriffs sind seitdem umstritten. Chris Allen definiert Islamfeindlichkeit als eine Ideologie, die Muslime und den Islam als das negativ konnotierte \u201eAndere\u201c konstruiert und damit von der Gruppe ausschlie\u00dft, mit der man sich selbst identifiziert. Islamfeindlichkeit verbreite einseitig negative Sichtweisen \u00fcber Islam und Muslime und diskriminiere Letztere gegen\u00fcber anderen Menschen. Muslime identifiziere sie anhand vermeintlicher oder tats\u00e4chlicher Merkmale und Eigenheiten des Islams, also nicht anhand des Selbstbildes der betroffenen Personen. Allen betont, dass Islamfeindlichkeit nicht immer explizit zum Ausdruck gebracht werde. Vielmehr sei sie auch in allt\u00e4glichen Praktiken und Diskursen vorhanden, ohne dass sich die darin Involvierten notwendigerweise als islamfeindlich verstehen m\u00fcssen.

Ferner betonte er die Wichtigkeit der Mundhygiene zur Parodontitispr\u00e4vention. Der Schriftsteller Mark Twain, der Riggs zur Behandlung seiner Parodontitis aufsuchte, brachte Riggs Fertigkeiten in seinem kurzen Essay Happy Memories of the Dental Chair zu Papier. Im 19. Jahrhundert hatten die Parodontopathien zahlreiche Bezeichnungen, wie Alveolarpyorrh\u00f6e, Alveolitis infectiosa, Caries alveolaris, Geissel medicorum, pyorrhee interalveolodentaire oder Pyorrhoea alveolaris.

Der Unterschied in den Verlaufsformen liegt in der Zeitspanne und der Prognose. Das akute Nierenversagen tritt entweder im Rahmen einer akuten Verschlechterung einer langj\u00e4hrigen vorbestehenden Nierenerkrankung wie einer chronischen Glomerulonephritis, einer diabetischen oder hypertensiven Nierensch\u00e4digung, durch einen langj\u00e4hrigen Medikamentenmissbrauch (besonders Schmerzmittelmissbrauch, siehe Analgetikanephropathie) oder durch einen akuten Vorfall (akute Glomerulonephritis, Autoimmunerkrankung, Unfall, Infektionen, Operation, Sepsis etc. ) auf. Es ist in den meisten F\u00e4llen prinzipiell reversibel und muss sich nicht zwangsl\u00e4ufig in ein terminales Nierenversagen entwickeln.

Eine urs\u00e4chliche Behandlung ist in der Regel nicht m\u00f6glich. Die Behandlung besteht in einer Optimierung der Kreislaufsituation und der Nierendurchblutung, dem Weglassen nierensch\u00e4dlicher Medikamente und der Beseitigung von Abflusshindernissen im Bereich der ableitenden Harnwege. Das chronische Nierenversagen kann bei Fortschreiten in das Terminalstadium letztlich die endg\u00fcltige Funktionsaufgabe der Nieren bedeuten, wobei trotzdem gewisse Teilfunktionen weiter aktiv sein k\u00f6nnen. Die h\u00e4ufigsten Ursachen in den Industrienationen sind Typ 2 Diabetes mellitus und Bluthochdruck aufgrund von Bewegungsmangel und Fehlern\u00e4hrung, weitere Ursachen sind chronische, oft unentdeckte Entz\u00fcndungen und Infektionen der Nieren, Verengungen der ableitenden Harnwege und angeborene Nierenkrankheiten wie beispielsweise Zystennieren.

Bis 1978 sind weltweit 25 F\u00e4lle, bis 1987 35 F\u00e4lle (davon 21 mit begleitenden neurologischen Symptomen) und bis 2005 \u00fcber 100 Patienten berichtet worden. Die Tangier-Krankheit wird autosomal-rezessiv vererbt. Der zugrunde liegende Gendefekt ist auf dem langen Arm des Chromosom 9 lokalisiert (9q31) und betrifft das ABCA 1-Gen. Letzteres kodiert f\u00fcr ein Transportprotein, das f\u00fcr die Ausschleusung von Cholesterin aus der Zelle verantwortlich ist. Durch den Gendefekt ist die Ausschleusung von Cholesterin aus der Zelle gest\u00f6rt, das so nicht zusammen mit Apolipoprotein A-I zur Bildung von High Density Lipoprotein im Blutserum beitragen kann. Hierdurch kommt es zu einem HDL-Mangel mit Serumkonzentrationen, die im Vergleich zu Normalpersonen um das 100\u2013200fache erniedrigt sind, w\u00e4hrend sich in der Zelle Cholesterinester ansammeln. Als Leitsymptom finden sich bereits im Kindesalter hypertrophe, gelb- bis orangegef\u00e4rbte Mandeln. Fredrickson dokumentierte diese Ver\u00e4nderung bereits in seiner Erstbeschreibung photographisch. Wurden die Tonsillen entfernt, finden sich als zuverl\u00e4ssige Befunde kleine (1\u20132 mm Durchmesser) Flecken in der Schleimhaut des Afters.

Es sind vor allem Hunde im Alter von sechs Monaten bis drei Jahren betroffen, eine Ersterkrankung jenseits des sechsten Lebensjahres ist unwahrscheinlich. H\u00e4ufiger betroffene Rassen sind Boxer, Dalmatiner, English Setter, Golden Retriever, Irish Setter, Labrador Retriever, Lhasa Apso, Shar-Pei, Shih-Tzu und Terrier. Die Ursache und Entstehung der Erkrankung ist, wie bei der atopischen Dermatitis des Menschen, noch nicht vollst\u00e4ndig aufgekl\u00e4rt. Vermutet wird eine genetisch bedingte \u00dcberempfindlichkeit gegen\u00fcber Fremdstoffen, die durch die Interaktion mit Umgebungsfaktoren zum Ausbruch der Erkrankung f\u00fchrt. Die Erkrankung wird \u00fcber eine ausgel\u00f6st, die durch Immunglobulin E vermittelt wird. Es wird angenommen, dass dar\u00fcber hinaus auch andere immunologische Vorg\u00e4nge mit Beteiligung von Immunglobulin G, Langerhans-Zellen, T-Lymphozyten, eosinophilen Granulozyten und Mastzellen beteiligt sind. Der allergieausl\u00f6sende Stoff (Allergen) wird haupts\u00e4chlich \u00fcber die Haut (perkutan) aufgenommen, aber auch durch Einatmung oder orale Aufnahme. Als Allergene kommen zahlreiche Antigene wie Hausstaubmilben, Vorratsmilben, Pollen, Schimmelpilze, Gr\u00e4ser, Insekten, Tierhaare und anderes in Betracht, wobei Milben f\u00fcr etwa 60 % der F\u00e4lle verantwortlich sind. W\u00e4hrend durch Milben bedingte Atopien ganzj\u00e4hrig auftreten, sind durch Pollen und Gr\u00e4ser ausgel\u00f6ste Formen vor allem im Fr\u00fchjahr und Sommer zu beobachten. Vermutlich liegt der Erkrankung eine St\u00f6rung der Barrierefunktion der Haut zugrunde, die das Eindringen von Allergenen erm\u00f6glicht."}

Die g\u00e4ngigsten Methoden sind die Epidermisscheide nach McIndoe, die Darmscheide, die Peritonealscheide und die Neovagina nach Vecchietti. Bei der laparoskopisch modifizierten Vecchietti-Operation wird in das meist vorhandene Scheidengr\u00fcbchen ein sogenanntes Phantom eingebracht. Laparoskopisch werden an diesem Phantom zwei F\u00e4den befestigt, die durch die Bauchdecke zu einem Spannapparat gef\u00fchrt werden. Der Spannapparat verbleibt nun vier bis sechs Tage auf dem Bauch. Durch Zug an den F\u00e4den zieht er die Scheide in die Bauchh\u00f6hle und verl\u00e4ngert sie bis auf zehn bis zw\u00f6lf Zentimeter. Anschlie\u00dfend werden zur Dehnung Dilatatoren eingesetzt.

Sie verhielten sich zwar oberfl\u00e4chlich wie blind, das hei\u00dft, sie konnten visuell Dinge nicht mehr erkennen, allerdings reagierten sie noch auf visuelle Reize. Eine Ver\u00f6ffentlichung zum Thema \u201eSeelenblindheit\u201c beim Menschen erfolgte 1886 von Hermann Wilbrand. Im Jahr 1890 beschrieb auch Heinrich Lissauer eine St\u00f6rung des visuellen Systems beim Menschen aufgrund eines von ihm untersuchten Falls, seines Patienten Gottlieb L. : Lissauer schlug zwei verschiedene Arten der Seelenblindheit vor: die apperzeptive Seelenblindheit und die assoziative Seelenblindheit: - Apperzeptive Seelenblindheit tritt aufgrund der Sch\u00e4digung der fr\u00fchen visuellen Areale auf und verhindert Objekterkennung durch das Unverm\u00f6gen, die verschiedenen Elemente visueller Wahrnehmung zu einem koh\u00e4renten Ganzen (Lissauer nannte dies eine \u201eVorstellung\u201c) zusammenzuf\u00fcgen. - Assoziative Seelenblindheit dagegen tritt auf, wenn die \u201eVorstellung\u201c nicht mit den Informationen und Wahrnehmungen anderer Modalit\u00e4ten zusammengebracht werden kann, um eine vorlinguistische Repr\u00e4sentation des Objekts zu erstellen. Der Begriff \u201eagnostisch\u201c oder \u201eAgnosie\u201c, der heute meist statt Seelenblindheit verwendet wird, wurde 1891 von Sigmund Freud eingef\u00fchrt, der darunter allerdings mehr neuropsychologische St\u00f6rungen des visuellen Systems im weiteren Sinne verstand, als nur die Seelenblindheit. Im freudschen Sinne umfasst die Agnosie neben der Seelenblindheit auch Rindenblindheit und optische Aphasie. Dennoch wird der Begriff (visuelle) Agnosie heutzutage f\u00fcr die Seelenblindheit mit den lissauerschen Unterkategorien verwendet. Wie bei vielen neurologischen St\u00f6rungen, so tr\u00e4gt auch hier die genaue Untersuchung des Krankheitsbildes nicht nur zur Erforschung der Krankheit selbst, sondern auch zu einem besseren Verst\u00e4ndnis des entsprechenden Prozesses im gesunden Gehirn \u2013 in diesem Falle des Sehprozesses \u2013 bei. Studien an Schlaganfallpatienten und an Affen haben gezeigt, dass der visuelle Wahrnehmungsapparat aus zwei spezialisierten Systemen besteht. Nach der grundlegenden Verarbeitung visueller Reize im prim\u00e4ren visuellen Kortex teilen sich die Verarbeitungswege in einen parietalen (entlang des Scheitels zentral nach vorne) und einen temporalen (zur Schl\u00e4fe hin gerichteten) Verarbeitungsstrom. Diese haben unterschiedliche Funktionen. Nach Mishkin und Ungerleider dient der Verarbeitungsstrom zur Schl\u00e4fe hin gerichtet vor allem der Objekterkennung (daher auch Was-Strom genannt), der am Scheitel entlanglaufende Verarbeitungsstrom der Bewegungs- und Entfernungsbestimmung (daher auch Wo-Strom genannt)."}

Es werden je nach Verlauf zwei Formen des 21-Hydroxylase-Mangels unterschieden. Beim klassischen AGS bestehen die Symptome schon im Neugeborenenalter. Es kann mit Salzverlust einhergehen, wenn auch die Aldosteron-Produktion gest\u00f6rt ist. Ist letztere nicht betroffen, besteht kein Salzverlust. Das nicht-klassische AGS manifestiert sich erst sp\u00e4ter, meist in der Pubert\u00e4t oder sogar erst im Erwachsenenalter und ist durch eine wesentlich mildere Symptomatik gekennzeichnet. Defekte am StAR-Protein treten geh\u00e4uft in Japan und S\u00fcdkorea auf. Da die Produktion der Nebennierenrindenhormone einem Regelkreis unterliegt, versuchen der Hypothalamus und die Hirnanhangdr\u00fcse (Hypophyse) durch vermehrte Aussch\u00fcttung des nebennierenrindenstimulierenden Hormons ACTH (Adrenocorticotropes Hormon), den Cortisol-Mangel zu kompensieren. Dies f\u00fchrt zu einer Gr\u00f6\u00dfenzunahme (Hyperplasie) der Nebennierenrinde und die Synthesekaskade der Nebennierenrindenhormone wird bis zum Punkt des eigentlichen Enzymdefekts stark angeregt. Zudem kann die erh\u00f6hte ACTH-Sekretion auch die Synthese von allen Corticoiden, darunter vor allem Androgenen, deren Sekretion nicht gest\u00f6rt ist, pathologisch direkt stimulieren. Es kommt zu einer vermehrten Bildung der Hormonvorstufen (Steroide), die wegen des Enzymmangels weder zu Cortisol noch Aldosteron, sondern auf alternativen Stoffwechselwegen zu Androgenen abgebaut werden. Die Androgene f\u00fchren zur Virilisierung. Der Salzverlust entsteht durch die mangelnde Mineralokortikoid-Wirkung, wenn auch die Synthese von Aldosteron gest\u00f6rt ist."}

Bei mangelhafter Laktaseaktivit\u00e4t gelangt ungespaltener Milchzucker beim Menschen bis in den Dickdarm, wo er von Darmbakterien aufgenommen und vergoren wird.

Normalerweise ist die Speiser\u00f6hre in ihrer gesamten Ausdehnung von mehrschichtigem Plattenepithel ausgekleidet. Durch wiederholte oder chronische Entz\u00fcndungen, h\u00e4ufig infolge des gastro\u00f6sophagealen Refluxes, kann sich dieses Epithel in einschichtiges, hochprismatisches Zylinderepithel mit Becherzellen umwandeln, wie es f\u00fcr die Darmschleimhaut typisch ist (sog. spezialisiertes Zylinderepithel). Als Ursache dieser intestinalen Metaplasie wird eine Fehlsteuerung bei der Regeneration der Schleimhaut nach erosiver Speiser\u00f6hrenentz\u00fcndung angesehen. Das Zylinderepithel ist zwar widerstandsf\u00e4higer gegen\u00fcber der S\u00e4ure- und Pepsinbelastung, tr\u00e4gt daf\u00fcr das Risiko weiterer Entartung (Dysplasie, Adenokarzinom) in sich. Au\u00dferdem neigt es zur Ulzeration (Barrett-Ulkus) und Ausbildung von Strikturen. Zylinderepithelauskleidungen vom Kardia- oder Fundustyp werden nicht als Barrett-\u00d6sophagus bezeichnet, da dieses Epithel nicht mit einer erh\u00f6hten malignen Potenz verbunden ist. Die Metaplasie bildet sich in den allermeisten F\u00e4llen direkt am gastro\u00f6sophagealen \u00dcbergang aus, also am Endsegment der Speiser\u00f6hre, kurz bevor diese in den Magen m\u00fcndet."}

Der konsekutive Hyperaldosteronismus f\u00fchrt zu einer vermehrten R\u00fcckresorption von Natrium, der die Kaliumverluste steigert.

Klinische Kriterien sind: - Manifestation bereits bei Geburt oder im S\u00e4uglingsalter - Eventuell bereits Intrauterine Wachstumsretardierung - Gelenkschwellungen mit Gelenkkontrakturen - verdickte, wenig elastische Haut - vermehrt pigmentierte Kn\u00f6tchen im Gesicht, Nacken und der Kopfhaut - massive Gingivahyperplasie - perianale Kn\u00f6tchen - H\u00e4ufig Neigung zu Infekten, therapieresistente Diarrhoe aufgrund von Protein-Verlust Enteropathien, Gedeihst\u00f6rung und Osteopenie Die Diagnose ergibt sich aus den klinischen Befunden und kann auf grund der Ansammlung von hyaliner Substanz im K\u00f6rpergewebe histologisch durch Gewebeprobe gesichert werden. Abzugrenzen sind: - Juvenile hyaline Fibromatose (s. o. Ursache) - MONA-Spektrum - Urbach-Wiethe-Syndrom - Morbus Hunter - Farber-Syndrom - I-Zellkrankheit - Pseudo-Hurler Polydystrophie - Infantile Myofibromatose - Stiff-skin-Syndrom - Infantile kortikale Hyperostose Die Krankheit verschlechtert sich zunehmend, meist versterben Betroffene innerhalb der ersten beiden Lebensjahre aufgrund von Atemwegsinfektionen und Diarrhoe. Im Erwachsenenalter stehen Gelenkkontrakturen im Vordergrund."}

Die Klassifikation von IIPs der American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) aus dem Jahr 2002 wurde 2013 aktualisiert.

Zu den h\u00e4ufig auftretenden IIPs z\u00e4hlen chronisch fibrosierende IPs (darunter IPF und nichtspezifische interstitielle Pneumonie [NSIP]), rauchbedingte IPs (respiratorische Bronchiolitis mit interstitieller Lungenerkrankung [RB-ILD] und desquamative interstitielle Pneumonie [DIP]) sowie akute/subakute IPs (kryptogene organisierende Pneumonie [COP] und akute interstitielle Pneumonie [AIP]). Zur Diagnose von IIPs m\u00fcssen bekannte Ursachen von ILD ausgeschlossen werden. Beispiele f\u00fcr ILDs mit bekannten Ursachen sind unter anderem hypersensitive Pneumonitis, Langerhans-Zell-Histiozytose, Asbestose und Kollagen-Gef\u00e4\u00dfkrankheit.

Die infantile oder nephropathische Cystinose ist die h\u00e4ufigste Form. Sie beruht auf einem Defekt des CTNS-Gens auf Chromosom 17, das f\u00fcr das lysosomale Membranprotein Cystinosin kodiert. Cystinosin ist f\u00fcr den Transport von Cystin aus dem Lysosom verantwortlich. Die Erkrankung wird autosomal-rezessiv vererbt und tritt in einer von 200. 000 Geburten auf. Ebenso werden eine adoleszente Form mit Krankheitsbeginn im Jugendalter und eine Erwachsenenform unterschieden. Die genauen Ursachen der letzteren beiden Formen sind bisher nicht gekl\u00e4rt. Nach den ersten symptomfreien Lebensmonaten beginnt die Krankheit mit unspezifischen Allgemeinsymptomen wie Appetitlosigkeit, Erbrechen, chronischer Verstopfung, Gewichtsstillstand, unklarem Fieber, Dystrophie, Polydipsie, Polyurie und einer Vitamin-D-refrakt\u00e4ren Rachitis.

RAR\u03b1 bindet in Abwesenheit des Liganden all-trans-Retins\u00e4ure (Tretinoin, engl. all-trans retionic acid, Kurzform all-trans RA oder ATRA) an die DNA und interagiert mit einem Komplex zur Transkriptionsunterdr\u00fcckung, welcher Histon-Deacetylasen (HDAC) rekrutiert. Deacetylierung der Histone hat die Bildung von Heterochromatin und somit eine Unterdr\u00fcckung der Transkription zur Folge. Das onkogene Fusionsprotein (PML/RARalpha) h\u00e4lt diese Interaktion nun auch in Anwesenheit des Liganden aufrecht, was eine konstitutive Unterdr\u00fcckung der RARalpha-regulierten Gene zur Folge hat. Es kommt zu einer transkriptionell unterdr\u00fcckten Differenzierungs-Blockade und somit zu einer gest\u00f6rten Zellreifung der Promyelozyten. Die Diagnose sollte mittels genetischem Nachweis des PML-RARA-Fusionsproteins erfolgen, durch einen RT-PCR-Assay, Nachweis der t(15;17)-Translokation durch eine konventionelle Karyotypisierung oder Fluoreszenz-in-situ-Hybridisierung, oder durch Nachweis der f\u00fcr die Promyelozytenleuk\u00e4mie typischen Mikrosprenkelung der Promyelozyten im indirekten Immunofluoreszenz-Assay.

Alle Formen einer akuten Gastritis k\u00f6nnen subakute Stadien einnehmen oder chronisch werden. Anhand der Ursache (\u00c4tiologie) werden verschiedene Untertypen der Gastritis unterschieden: Die Typ-A-Gastritis ist eine Autoimmunkrankheit, deren Pathogenese noch nicht v\u00f6llig gekl\u00e4rt ist und bei der Autoantik\u00f6rper die s\u00e4ureproduzierenden Belegzellen (Parietalzellen) angreifen. Sie macht etwa 5 % der Gastritiden aus. Durch den Zellverlust kommt es in Folge zu einem Anstieg des pH-Wertes im Magen, was die Gastrinproduktion permanent anregt. Gastrin seinerseits regt die neuroendokrinen ECL-Zellen des Magens an und wirkt trophisch. Es kommt zu einer Hyperplasie dieser Zellen. Die erh\u00f6hte Gastrinmenge f\u00f6rdert au\u00dferdem die Entstehung von Mikrokarzinoiden. Da die Zerst\u00f6rung der Intrinsic Factor-bildenden Belegzellen eine verminderte Resorption von Vitamin B (Cobalamin) im Ileum nach sich ziehen kann, kann ein Vitamin-B-Mangel resultieren (pernizi\u00f6se An\u00e4mie). Der Typ-B-Gastritis liegt eine bakterielle Infektion zugrunde, die zumeist von dem korkenzieherartig geformten Helicobacter pylori (HP) verursacht wird. Sie ist mit einem Anteil von 85 % die h\u00e4ufigste Gastritis-Form. Nach f\u00e4kal-oraler Aufnahme breitet sich der Erreger ausgehend vom Mageneingang in Richtung Magenausgang aus.

Weitere F\u00e4lle in anderen Staaten sind bekannt. Hervorgerufen wird das RAPADILINO-Syndrom durch eine Mutation im RECQL4-Gen. Dieses Gen codiert f\u00fcr die ATP-abh\u00e4ngige DNA-Helikase Q4, ein Enzym, das die zwei gewundenen Str\u00e4nge (Doppelhelix) der DNA aufspaltet und somit sowohl die Replikation als auch die Reparatur der DNA erm\u00f6glicht. Bisher sind vier verschiedene Mutationen bekannt, die zu der Erkrankung f\u00fchren. Zum einen wurden drei nonsense-Mutationen beschrieben (in den Exons 5, 18 und 19), also Mutationen, die ein falsches Stopcodon erzeugen und damit zur Verk\u00fcrzung sowie zum Funktionsverlust des entstehenden Proteins f\u00fchren. Weitaus h\u00e4ufiger tritt allerdings eine in frame-Deletion auf, die zur Folge hat, dass Exon 7 beim Splei\u00dfen f\u00e4lschlicherweise vollst\u00e4ndig aus dem Protein entfernt wird und daher 44 von 1208 Aminos\u00e4uren fehlen. Zu einem Frameshift kommt es demzufolge nicht. Bemerkenswert ist dabei, dass das fehlende Exon 7 bei der in frame-Deletion nicht die eigentliche Helikase-Dom\u00e4ne (das aktive Zentrum) betrifft. Das bedeutet, dass die Struktur, die die eigentliche Funktion der Helikase (Spaltung der DNA-Doppelhelix) \u00fcbernimmt, intakt ist. Die Fehlfunktion ist in diesem Fall vermutlich auf eine fehlerhafte Faltung des Proteins zur\u00fcckzuf\u00fchren, die durch das Fehlen von Exon 7 erzeugt wird. Urs\u00e4chlich f\u00fcr eine inkorrekte Faltung k\u00f6nnte die Verschiebung des isoelektrischen Punktes von 8,45 auf 8,78 sein; auch eine verst\u00e4rkte Polarit\u00e4t des gesamten Enzyms kommt in Betracht, da in Exon 7 mit zehn Prolin-Seitenketten ein gr\u00f6\u00dferer hydrophober Bereich entf\u00e4llt. W\u00e4hrend die Ursache auf molekulargenetischer Ebene hinreichend gekl\u00e4rt scheint, ist derzeit noch unklar, wie es durch die Fehlfunktion der RecQ-Helikase zu den charakteristischen Symptomen kommt."}

Durch das Fehlen funktionsf\u00e4higer Glucose-6-phosphat-Dehydrogenase kann nicht ausreichend NADPH zur Regenerierung des Glutathions bereitgestellt werden, so dass Peroxide ungehindert die Membran und die SH-Gruppen der Proteine des Erythrozyten angreifen k\u00f6nnen. Im Allgemeinen erfolgt beim Favismus eine H\u00e4molyse nur dann, wenn die Patienten Substanzen zu sich nehmen, die Wasserstoffperoxid bilden, wie beispielsweise: - Bohnen, vor allem Saubohnen (Vicia faba, daher die Bezeichnung \u201eFavismus\u201c) - Erbsen - Johannisbeeren - Acetylsalicyls\u00e4ure - Metamizol - Sulfonamide - Vitamin K und Derivate - Naphthalin - Anilin und Derivate - Malariamittel - Nitrofurane Weitere Ausl\u00f6ser k\u00f6nnen virale oder bakterielle Infektionen, Stress und eine metabolische Azidose sein. Nach Genuss oben genannter Ausl\u00f6ser kommt es innerhalb von Stunden oder wenigen Tagen zu einer schweren, unter Umst\u00e4nden lebensbedrohlichen h\u00e4molytischen An\u00e4mie mit Fieber, Sch\u00fcttelfrost, R\u00fccken- und Bauchschmerzen sowie Schw\u00e4che bis hin zum Schock. Um der H\u00e4molyse entgegenzuwirken, werden in verst\u00e4rktem Ma\u00df Retikulozyten, die Vorl\u00e4uferzellen der Erythrozyten, in das Blut abgegeben, deren Glucose-6-phosphat-Dehydrogenase bei hemizygoten dunkelh\u00e4utigen und heterozygoten Personen noch Restaktivit\u00e4t zeigt, sodass die Krise \u00fcberwunden werden kann. Bei hellh\u00e4utigen Erkrankten dagegen ist der Mangel an funktionsf\u00e4higem Enzym in der Regel viel st\u00e4rker ausgepr\u00e4gt, sodass es unter Umst\u00e4nden zur H\u00e4moglobinurie mit komplettem Nierenversagen kommen kann. Eine kausale Therapie gibt es derzeit (2014) nicht. Die Therapie besteht daher in der Vermeidung der Aufnahme oben genannter Substanzen. Die Lebenserwartung unterscheidet sich dann nicht von jener gesunder Menschen. Bei extremen h\u00e4molytischen Krisen wurde in einem Fall menschliches Haptoglobin zum Abfangen des freien H\u00e4moglobins genutzt, um die entstehende Hyperbilirubin\u00e4mie abzuschw\u00e4chen. Die relativ niedrigere Pr\u00e4valenz von Malariainfektionen bei Menschen mit Glc-6-P-DH-Mangel, die in Malaria Endemiegebieten leben, kann durch den Selektionsvorteil, den dieser Defekt bringt, erkl\u00e4rt werden: Malariaerreger (Plasmodien) reagieren empfindlicher als menschliche Zellen auf Radikale und k\u00f6nnen sich daher durch die St\u00f6rung des Pentosephosphatweges und die dadurch in den menschlichen Erythrozyten angeh\u00e4uften Radikale nicht ausreichend vermehren. Eine Malariatherapie mit Chloroquin l\u00f6st allerdings bei vorliegendem Favismus durch eine hohe Radikalbildung ebenfalls eine H\u00e4molyse aus."}

In besonders schweren F\u00e4llen der neonataler H\u00e4mochromatose, bei denen sich Eisenablagerungen in diversen Organen gebildet haben, tritt der Tod des Kindes bereits vor der Geburt (in utero) ein. Kinder, die die Schwangerschaft \u00fcberleben, versterben unbehandelt meist im Verlauf der ersten Wochen nach der Geburt im hepatischen Koma, ausgel\u00f6st durch ein fulminantes Leberversagen mit Lebernekrose.

His101Gln, bei der schwereren und fr\u00fcher einsetzenden Erkrankung die Mutation c. 744delA. Klinische Kriterien sind: - Manifestation zwischen dem 5. und 20. Lebensjahr bei der schwereren Form, bei der leichteren Form erst nach dem 30. Lebensjahr - fortschreitende Spinozerebell\u00e4re Ataxie mit Dysdiadochokinese, Dysarthrie und Gangunsicherheit - Verlust der Propriozeption bis zur Areflexie - deutlicher Mangel an Vitamin E - eventuell auch Retinitis pigmentosa Die Diagnose beruht auf den Befunden der Klinischen Untersuchung, der Bestimmung des Vitamin-E-Spiegels im Blutplasma bei normalen Lipid- und Lipoprotein-Werten. Die Diagnose kann durch humangenetische Untersuchung gesichert werden."}

Charakteristisch f\u00fcr diese autosomal-dominant vererbte St\u00f6rung ist eine Mutation im Glucokinase(GCK)-Gen (Gen-Variante rs1799884). Ungeachtet dieser Risikofaktoren wird heute bei jeder schwangeren Frau zwischen der 24. und 28. Schwangerschaftswoche ein Zuckerbelastungstest (auch: oraler Glucose-Toleranztest) empfohlen. Betroffene Frauen bemerken h\u00e4ufig nichts von ihrer Erkrankung, da der Schwangerschaftsdiabetes meist beschwerdefrei bleibt. Anzeichen, wie etwa ein gesteigertes Durstgef\u00fchl (Polydipsie), Harnwegs- und Nierenentz\u00fcndungen, Zucker im Urin (Glucosurie), Ver\u00e4nderungen der Fruchtwassermenge, Wachstumsst\u00f6rungen des F\u00f6ten, die der betreuende Frauenarzt im Ultraschall feststellt, \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfige Gewichtszunahme und erh\u00f6hter Blutdruck (Arterielle Hypertonie) k\u00f6nnen jedoch auftreten. Zur Feststellung eines Schwangerschaftsdiabetes wird ein oraler Glukosetoleranztest (oGTT) durchgef\u00fchrt. Dabei unterscheidet man zwischen einem Suchtest (Screening) (50g Glucose in 200 ml Wasser), der unabh\u00e4ngig von der Tageszeit und vorheriger Nahrungsaufnahme mit Messung der Blutglukose aus ven\u00f6sem Plasma 1 Stunde nach Trinken der L\u00f6sung durchgef\u00fchrt wird, und dem diagnostischen 75g oGTT, der sp\u00e4testens dann durchgef\u00fchrt wird, wenn der Blutglucosewert im Suchtest \u00fcber 135 mg/dl liegt. Andere Parameter wie der Glucosegehalt des Urins, der HbA1c oder die N\u00fcchternglucose sind als Suchtest nicht geeignet. Beim 75g-oGTT, der unter standardisierten Bedingungen durchgef\u00fchrt werden sollte, werden 75 g Glucose in 300 ml Wasser innerhalb von 3-5 Minuten getrunken. Liegt mindestens ein Blutglucosewert im ven\u00f6sen Plasma \u00fcber den definierten Grenzwerten (n\u00fcchtern: 92, nach 1 Stunde 180, nach 2 Stunden 153 mg/dl), gilt die Diagnose als gesichert."}

Deshalb diffundiert bei einem Tauchgang auf z.

Die verschiedenen Gewebe werden in Dekompressionsmodellen im Allgemeinen als Kompartimente bezeichnet. Die Stickstoffanreicherung in den Geweben (Aufs\u00e4ttigung), wie auch die sp\u00e4tere Abgabe des Stickstoffs beim Auftauchen (Ents\u00e4ttigung), geschieht mit unterschiedlicher Geschwindigkeit, je nach Durchblutung der Gewebe."}

Die Folge der Bek\u00e4mpfung ist die besagte Entz\u00fcndungsreaktion. Die zweite These geht von einem bis jetzt nicht entdeckten Bakterium oder Virus aus, das im Rahmen einer chronischen Infektion zu besagter Entz\u00fcndungsreaktion f\u00fchrt. Auch soll eine Verbindung zur Z\u00f6liakie bestehen, was allerdings nicht belegt ist. Mittlerweile geht der Konsens eher in Richtung der ersten Variante, also des Autoimmungeschehens. An die bakterielle/virale Genese glaubt kaum noch jemand, auch wenn nicht sicher ausgeschlossen werden kann, dass am Anfang der Reaktionskette ein vor\u00fcbergehender Darminfekt steht, der dann \u00fcber teilweise autoimmunologische Prozesse in die chronische Entz\u00fcndung m\u00fcndet. Insofern kann am ehesten von einem multifaktoriell bedingten Geschehen ausgegangen werden. Therapeutisch hat sich ein Konzept herauskristallisiert, das im Wesentlichen dem Vorgehen bei Morbus Crohn entspricht: eine Kombinationstherapie aus Cortison und 5-Aminosalicyls\u00e4ure (klassisch: Budesonid oder Prednisolon und Mesalazin). Die Grundidee ist, die Entz\u00fcndungsreaktion mit einer kurzfristigen Hochdosisgabe zu durchbrechen und dann mit einer Erhaltungstherapie im Zaum zu halten, wobei das Regime jeweils auf den Einzelfall abgestimmt sein muss. Die einzige in Deutschland zur Therapie zugelassene und durch Evidenz in ihrer Effektivit\u00e4t gesicherte Substanz ist allerdings Budesonid; Mesalazin hat keine Zulassung. Der Einsatz von TNF-alpha-Antik\u00f6rpern (Infliximab, Adalimumab) kann in Einzelf\u00e4llen eindrucksvolle Therapieerfolge erzielen, hat jedoch keine Zulassung zur Therapie. Di\u00e4tma\u00dfnahmen bringen im Allgemeinen nichts, es sei denn, der Patient stellt individuell fest, dass er bestimmte Dinge weniger gut vertr\u00e4gt als andere. Auch andere Therapieformen haben sich im Verlauf der letzten 25 Jahre als nicht wirksam erwiesen.

Daher r\u00fchrt die weitere Bezeichnung der Kinderl\u00e4hmung als Heine-Medin-Krankheit. Nach heutigen Erkenntnissen existierte Polio bis 1880 als endemische Krankheit. Erst ab etwa 1880 trat diese Infektionskrankheit in epidemischer Form auf, die j\u00e4hrlich tausende Menschen betraf. Darunter waren vor allem Kinder, die daran verstarben oder dauerhaft mit k\u00f6rperlichen Folgesch\u00e4den leben mussten.

Auch deshalb wird, die prim\u00e4re Folge des Gendefekts ber\u00fccksichtigend, heute besser von einer kompletten Androgenresistenz (CAIS) gesprochen.

Von einer inkompletten Androgenresistenz (PAIS und MAIS = partielle bzw. minimale Androgenresistenz) unterscheidet sich die komplette Androgenresistenz (CAIS) somit vor allem bez\u00fcglich der Entwicklung des sozialen Geschlechts, so dass ein gesonderter Beitrag gerechtfertigt ist. Die nicht-Androgen-abh\u00e4ngigen Schritte der Sexualdifferenzierung sind weiter m\u00f6glich: Das in den Sertoli-Zellen der embryonalen Hoden gebildete Anti-M\u00fcller-Hormon (AMH) bewirkt eine R\u00fcckbildung der zun\u00e4chst bei beiden Geschlechtern vorhandenen M\u00fcller-G\u00e4nge, die wiederum die Anlagen f\u00fcr Geb\u00e4rmutter und Eileiter darstellen, so dass diese Organe nicht ausgebildet werden.

Diese Form der Dystonie ist dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass zwar der Bewegungsapparat im Allgemeinen intakt ist, aber beim Ausf\u00fchren einer erlernten Bewegung wie etwa der Zupfbewegung an der Gitarre oder der Anschlagsbewegung am Klavier der Finger oder die Hand nicht in der Lage ist, diese Bewegung zu vollf\u00fchren, w\u00e4hrend die gleiche Bewegung ohne Instrument oder in einem anderen Kontext oft v\u00f6llig st\u00f6rungsfrei verl\u00e4uft.

In der Regel fallen die Thrombozyten nicht unter 80. 000/\u03bcl. Die HIT Typ II beruht auf einer Antik\u00f6rperbildung gegen Heparin/Protein-Komplexe.

Pl\u00e4ttchenfaktor 4 ist ein stark positiv geladenes Protein, das aus Blutpl\u00e4ttchen freigesetzt wird. Gegen den Medikament/Proteinkomplex - das Antigen - entwickeln einige Patienten Antik\u00f6rper. Nach der Bindung an den Komplex binden die Antik\u00f6rper mit ihrem Fc-Teil an einen Rezeptor auf den Thrombozyten. Dadurch verklumpen die Thrombozyten untereinander und werden aktiviert.

In den sp\u00e4ten 1970er Jahren wurde festgestellt, dass es sich dabei um eine spongiforme Enzephalopathie \u00e4hnlich der schon lange bekannten Scrapie des Schafs handelt. Chronic Wasting Disease kommt im westlichen Teil Nordamerikas nat\u00fcrlich vor. Sie bef\u00e4llt wild lebende Maultierhirsche, Wei\u00dfwedelhirsche und Wapitis in Wyoming, Colorado, Nebraska, South Dakota und Wisconsin. Bei in Gefangenschaft lebenden Hirschherden wurde die Krankheit auch in anderen westlichen Staaten der USA sowie im westlichen Kanada festgestellt. Die Pr\u00e4valenz kann in befallenen Herden in Gefangenschaft bis zu 100 % betragen; in freier Wildbahn werden Pr\u00e4valenzen von unter einem bis \u00fcber 30 Prozent gefunden. Der erste bekannte europ\u00e4ische Fall war ein weibliches Rentier aus der Nordfjella Population in S\u00fcdnorwegen, bei der der Erreger 2016 nachgewiesen wurde. In S\u00fcdkorea ist die Krankheit in einer Herde aus Kanada importierter Wapitihirsche aufgetreten. Wie bei den anderen transmissiblen spongiformen Enzephalopathien handelt es sich beim Erreger vermutlich um ein abnorm gefaltetes Prion, das allerdings bisher nicht isoliert werden konnte. Die \u00dcbertragung erfolgt von Tier zu Tier; eine \u00dcbertragung vom Muttertier auf die Nachkommen kann vorkommen, hat aber f\u00fcr die \u00dcbertragung keine gro\u00dfe Bedeutung. Experimentell l\u00e4sst sich CWD durch Injektion von infekti\u00f6sem Material direkt ins Gehirn auch auf Rinder, Schafe, Ziegen, Frettchen, Nerze, M\u00e4use, Goldhamster und Totenkopfaffen \u00fcbertragen.

Es ist unbekannt, auf welchem Weg ein infiziertes Tier das infekti\u00f6se Agens wieder ausscheidet, jedoch scheint eine Ausscheidung \u00fcber den Kot wahrscheinlich.

Der erste Komplex umfasst allgemeine Entz\u00fcndungsreaktionen wie Fieber, Nachtschwei\u00df, Gewichtsverlust und Gliederschmerzen und kann \u00fcber Jahre andauern. Die entstehenden Gef\u00e4\u00dfeinengungen f\u00fchren zu den Symptomen des zweiten Komplexes: Durchblutungsst\u00f6rungen der Extremit\u00e4ten, Schwindel, Ohnmachtsanf\u00e4lle, Sehst\u00f6rungen, Schlaganfall und Bluthochdruck. Die Takayasu-Arteriitis bef\u00e4llt bevorzugt die gro\u00dfen Arterien vom elastischen Typ. Die Granulome bilden sich vor allem in der mittleren Schicht der Gef\u00e4\u00dfwand, die dadurch zerst\u00f6rt wird. Einsetzende Vernarbungsprozesse f\u00fchren dann zu einer Einengung des Gef\u00e4\u00dfdurchmessers und damit zu einem Hindernis f\u00fcr den Blutstrom. Bedingt durch den hohen Druck, der in den herznahen Gef\u00e4\u00dfen herrscht, kann es langfristig jedoch auch zur Bildung von Aneurysmen (Aussackungen der Gef\u00e4\u00dfwand) kommen. Die Diagnosestellung erfolgt anhand der ACR-Kriterien, von denen mindestens drei vorhanden sein m\u00fcssen: - Alter < 40 Jahre - Claudicatio der Extremit\u00e4ten (vor allem der Arme) - Abgeschw\u00e4chter Puls der Brachialarterien (daher auch pulseless disease) - Blutdruckdifferenz zwischen beiden Armen > 10 mmHg (systolisch) - Str\u00f6mungsger\u00e4usche \u00fcber der Aorta oder Arteria subclavia - Ver\u00e4nderungen im Arteriogramm Im Gegensatz zur Granulomatose mit Polyangiitis finden sich bei der Takayasu-Arteriitis keine ANCA-Autoantik\u00f6rper. Die Gabe von Glucocorticoiden ist nach wie vor die medikament\u00f6se Therapie der Wahl. Bei Rezidiven werden auch Methotrexat, Azathioprin oder TNF-Blocker eingesetzt."}

Man nimmt jedoch an, dass ein Teil der TSS-F\u00e4lle von infizierten Tampons stamme. Diese Annahme f\u00fchrte in den Vereinigten Staaten zu zahlreichen Prozessen, darunter der des Anwaltes Tom Riley gegen Procter & Gamble, beschrieben in seinem Buch The Price of a Life. Das Streptokokken-induzierte toxische Schock-Syndrom (STSS) ist die bedrohlichste Form einer sogenannten invasiven Streptokokkeninfektion, das hei\u00dft einer Infektion, bei der Streptokokken in den K\u00f6rper eindringen. Es wird haupts\u00e4chlich durch Streptokokken des Typs A, aber auch durch Streptokokken des Typs C oder des Typs G verursacht. Als Ursache der Erkrankung wurden bestimmte Exotoxine (so genannten Superantigene), die von humanpathogenen St\u00e4mmen des Staphylococcus aureus und des Streptococcus pyogenes produziert werden, identifiziert. Durch verbesserte Produktionsbedingungen bei der Tamponherstellung sind die F\u00e4lle des tamponinduzierten TSS jedoch signifikant gesunken. Weitere relevante Infektionsquellen k\u00f6nnen bei Frauen Diaphragmen und Vaginalschw\u00e4mme sein. Auch eine Wundinfektion kann ein TSS ausl\u00f6sen. Die CDC schlugen folgende Kriterien zur Definition des streptokokken-induzierten toxischen Schock-Syndroms vor: - Nachweis von Streptokokken des Typs A, Hypotonie (niedriger Blutdruck) sowie mindestens zwei der folgenden Symptome: - Sch\u00e4digung der Nieren (verringerte Harnausscheidung), Koagulopathie (Blutungsst\u00f6rungen), Leberfunktionsst\u00f6rungen, Hautausschlag (der sich ausweiten kann, insbesondere 1\u20132 Wochen nach Ausbruch der Krankheit), Atembeschwerden, Gewebsnekrosen (Myositis, Nekrotisierende Fasciitis, Gangr\u00e4n) Zu weiteren Testverfahren z\u00e4hlen unter anderem Blutkulturen und Bluttests sowie Urinuntersuchungen.

Eine pulmonale Hypertonie liegt vor, wenn der mittlere Blutdruck in der Lungenschlagader (Pulmonalarterie) vom Normalwert (12\u201316 mmHg) auf mehr als 25 mmHg in Ruhe ansteigt. Im Bereich von 30 bis 40 mmHg k\u00f6nnen erste klinische Symptome, insbesondere unter Belastung, beobachtet werden. Im Bereich von 50 bis 70 mmHg nimmt die Herzauswurfleistung kontinuierlich ab. Der pulmonal-arterielle Blutdruck kann weiter auf \u00fcber 100 mmHg chronisch ansteigen. Die Feststellung, dass eine pulmonale Hypertonie vorliegt, ist die Beschreibung eines gemessenen Wertes mit der Echokardiographie oder als genaue Messung mit dem Rechtsherzkatheter.

Durch den Umbau der Lungenarterien wird immer weniger Sauerstoff \u00fcber die Lunge aufgenommen, w\u00e4hrend sich durch den erh\u00f6hten pulmonal-arteriellen Widerstand die Herzauswurfleistung verringert.

Bei einem schreienden Baby, das sich partout nicht beruhigen l\u00e4sst, sollte die Diagnose aber immer im Hinterkopf behalten werden. Da die Untersuchung mit Hilfe der Sonographie keine absolute Sicherheit bietet und eine Torsion in kurzer Zeit zum Verlust des Hodens und schlimmeren Konsequenzen f\u00fchrt, ist im Zweifel die diagnostische operative Hodenfreilegung notwendig. Bei einer Torsion wird gleichzeitig die Therapie durchgef\u00fchrt. Die Hodentorsion ist immer ein Notfall. \u00c4rztliche Hilfe ist schnell erforderlich, da die Torsion schon nach vier bis sechs Stunden bleibende Sch\u00e4den hervorrufen kann. Durch eine Operation (Detorquierung) kann man den Hoden retten oder ihn gegebenenfalls entfernen, wenn er schon infarziert ist. Im Normalfall wird auch der nicht betroffene Hoden fixiert, um eine erneute Torsion an diesem zu verhindern (Orchidopexie)."}

Solange also ein beschwerdefreies Sehen in Ferne und N\u00e4he m\u00f6glich ist, braucht eine Hyperopie nicht korrigiert zu werden. Bei Kindern ist eine Hyperopie Teil des Entwicklungsprozesses. In der Regel reduziert sie sich im Laufe des Wachstums (siehe Grafik). H\u00f6hergradige Hyperopien \u00fcber drei Dioptrien sollten jedoch auch im Kindesalter \u2013 zumindest teilweise \u2013 korrigiert werden, da sonst die Gefahr einer Schielerkrankung bestehen kann. Die F\u00e4higkeit zur Akkommodation nimmt jedoch mit zunehmendem Lebensalter ab und erreicht abh\u00e4ngig vom Grad der Hyperopie meist zwischen dem 35. und 45. Lebensjahr einen Wert, der zum scharfen Sehen, zun\u00e4chst in der N\u00e4he und sp\u00e4ter auch in der Ferne, nicht mehr ausreicht. Diese physiologische Alterssichtigkeit (Presbyopie) macht sich so fr\u00fcher bemerkbar als bei Menschen ohne Hyperopie. Wenn durch die nachlassende Akkommodationsleistung der Linse Probleme in der N\u00e4he auftreten, bewirkt die Korrektur der Hyperopie zun\u00e4chst eine Verbesserung des Nahsehens, aber auch eine generelle Entlastung der Akkommodation \u2013 auch beim Blick in die Ferne. Sp\u00e4ter, bei weiter zunehmender Presbyopie, wird eine zus\u00e4tzliche Nahkorrektur erforderlich.

M\u00f6glicherweise spielt bei der (typischen) OCD an der medialen Femurkondyle eine St\u00f6rung des Bewegungsablaufs beim Rennen und Springen eine entscheidende Rolle. Sehr h\u00e4ufig kann bei den Patienten der OD am Knie eine langj\u00e4hrige und intensive Trampolin-Nutzung erfragt werden. Diese sportliche Besonderheit ist nicht \u00fcberraschend: Es handelt sich um hoch belastete repetitive Beanspruchung. Bei der selteneren Osteochondrosis dissecans der lateralen Femurkondyle spielt oft eine Meniskuspathologie (z. B. ein Scheibenmeniskus) und m\u00f6glicherweise auch kindliches Rheuma eine Rolle. Bei der ebenfalls h\u00e4ufigen OCD der medialen Talusschulter im oberen Sprunggelenk handelt es sich eventuell um eine echte OCD mit sportbedingter repetitiver \u00dcberlastung.

Die \u00dcbertragung von der Zecke auf den Hund erfolgt relativ schnell, sie kann bereits drei Stunden nach dem Anheften der Zecke erfolgen. E. canis bindet sich an Oberfl\u00e4chen-Glykoproteine der Monozyten. \u00dcber Endozytose gelangt der Erreger in diese Blutzellen und verhindert die Fusion der Endosomen mit Lysosomen und damit seine Vernichtung. In den Zellen kommt es zu einer Vermehrung des Bakteriums in Form einer Zweiteilung. Durch die Infektion unterdr\u00fcckt E. canis die Abwehrfunktion der Monozyten.

Die Ursachen von TIA entsprechen demzufolge weitgehend denen des Schlaganfalls (siehe dort). Daneben treten TIA gelegentlich auch bei anderen Erkrankungen auf, etwa bei der Migr\u00e4ne (hemiplegische Migr\u00e4ne). Im Unterschied zum Schlaganfall treten die Ausf\u00e4lle bei der Migr\u00e4ne jedoch nicht schlagartig und gleichzeitig auf, sondern typischerweise nacheinander. Oft wird auch trotz gr\u00fcndlicher Diagnostik keine Ursache f\u00fcr eine TIA gefunden. Die Symptome der TIA gleichen denen des Schlaganfalls, besonders typisch sind halbseitige L\u00e4hmungen von Arm und/oder Bein (Hemiplegie oder Hemiparese), Sprachst\u00f6rungen (Aphasie), Sprechst\u00f6rungen (Dysarthrie) und (eventuell halbseitige) Sehst\u00f6rungen (fl\u00fcchtige Erblindung). Eine TIA dauert definitionsgem\u00e4\u00df nicht l\u00e4nger als 24 Stunden; bis dahin haben sich alle Symptome zur\u00fcckgebildet. Meist geschieht dies allerdings schon w\u00e4hrend der ersten 1\u20132 Stunden. Die Diagnostik der TIA ist aber nicht nur durch die kurze Dauer der Symptome, sondern auch durch mehrere m\u00f6gliche Differentialdiagnosen erschwert. Meist sind die Symptome bei Einlieferung ins Krankenhaus schon abgeklungen und auch bildgebende Verfahren k\u00f6nnen keine eindeutige Diagnose liefern, wobei das MRT mit Diffusionsgewichtung (50 % Sensitivit\u00e4t) die beste Untersuchung darstellt. Im Akutstadium (solange die Symptome noch bestehen) kann zwischen einer TIA und einem Schlaganfall nicht unterschieden werden. Die Akutbehandlung muss sich deshalb am Vorgehen beim Schlaganfall orientieren, insbesondere ist eine rasche Diagnose zwingend. Im weiteren Verlauf (nach Abklingen der Symptome) ist besonders darauf zu achten, dass transitorische isch\u00e4mische Attacken h\u00e4ufig als Vorboten eines \u201egro\u00dfen\u201c Schlaganfalls auftreten, bei 10\u201330 % der Betroffenen folgt ein solcher innerhalb der n\u00e4chsten 5 Jahre."}

Eine Endokarditis aufgrund einer bakteriellen Infektion oder angeborene Mitralstenosen sind seltener.

Die Ursache f\u00fcr die Erkrankung sind Mutationen in den Genen, die f\u00fcr Kollagen-VI kodieren. Kollagen VI besteht aus 3 Untereinheiten, die von 3 verschiedenen Genen kodiert werden: COL6A1 und COL6A2 auf dem langen Arm von Chromosom 21 (21q22. 3) und COL6A3 auf dem langen Arm von Chromosom 2 (2q37).

Aber noch wesentlich seltener wird sie erkannt. Der Zeitpunkt der Erstmanifestation kann extrem variieren. Es k\u00f6nnen zum einen bereits im S\u00e4uglingsalter, zum anderen aber erst im fortgeschrittenen Senium die ersten Symptome entstehen. Tendenziell betrifft die Xanthinurie aber Kinder. Subklinische (symptomlose) Verlaufsformen finden sich nicht selten. Eine iatrogene (\u00e4rztlich verursachte) Xanthinurie kommt manchmal bei Gichtpatienten durch Applikation des XO-Inhibitors (Xanthinoxidasehemmer) Allopurinol vor. Auch ein Kofaktormangel (Eisen, FAD, Molybd\u00e4n) des Enzyms kann dessen Aktivit\u00e4t drosseln, und eine Xanthinurie bedingen. Die Xanthinoxidase katalysiert die Umwandlung von Hypoxanthin und Xanthin zu Harns\u00e4ure. Dies geschieht haupts\u00e4chlich in der Leber und in den Darmepithelien. Dort ist die Xanthinoxidaseaktivit\u00e4t am h\u00f6chsten. Als Nebenprodukt dieses Oxidierungsprozesses entsteht Wasserstoffperoxid (HO), welches mittels Peroxidasen entfernt werden muss.

Die Hamartome, die dieser Erkrankungsgruppe ihren Namen gaben, sind aber keine Tumoren, sondern geschwulst\u00e4hnliche Gewebsver\u00e4nderungen. Unter dem Begriff Neurokutane Erkrankungen wird in der wissenschaftlichen Literatur eine gr\u00f6\u00dfere Gruppe von Krankheiten verstanden, deren gemeinsames Merkmal in bestimmten pathogenetischen Mechanismen gesehen wird. In der modernen Literatur wird ein Teil der Phakomatosen unter dem Stichwort der Tumorsuppressorgen-Erkrankungen neu gegliedert. Zu den Phakomatosen im engeren Sinne werden im Sinne einer Sammelbezeichnung u. a. folgende Erkrankungen gez\u00e4hlt: - Neurofibromatose Typ 1 von Recklinghausen - Tuber\u00f6se Sklerose Bourneville-Pringle - Retino-cerebell\u00e4re Angiomatose Hippel-Lindau - Enzephalo-Faziale Angiomatose Sturge-Weber - Ataxia teleangiectatica Louis-Bar - Peutz-Jeghers-Syndrom \u2212 intestinale Polyposis mit perioraler Pigmentierung.

Zwei bei Subtypen der DC mutierte Gene (DKC1 und TERC) kodieren f\u00fcr Teile des Telomerase-Komplexes. Als Hauptursache der DC wird eine gest\u00f6rte Funktion der Telomerase angenommen.

Limitierende Faktoren f\u00fcr den Erfolg einer solchen Therapie sind allerdings die Blut-Hirn-Schranke, die nur von wenigen Antibiotika ausreichend durchdrungen wird, und die Tatsache, dass bereits untergegangenes Nervengewebe vom menschlichen Organismus nicht mehr ersetzt werden kann. Die Neurosyphilis war vor Einf\u00fchrung der Antibiotikatherapie eine sehr h\u00e4ufige Komplikation der Syphilis. Etwa 25 bis 30 Prozent der an einer Syphilis erkrankten Patienten entwickelten eine Neurosyphilis. Von diesen Patienten hatten jeweils etwa ein Drittel eine asymptomatische Neurosyphilis oder eine Tabes dorsalis und jeweils etwa 10 Prozent eine progressive Paralyse oder eine Lues cerebrospinalis."}

Unter Ber\u00fccksichtigung geographischer Unterschiede wird in Mitteleuropa eine Amblyopieh\u00e4ufigkeit von 5 bis 6 % der Bev\u00f6lkerung angenommen. Bestimmte Quellen stellen die Amblyopie als Hauptursache f\u00fcr visuelle Funktionseinschr\u00e4nkungen w\u00e4hrend der ersten 45 Lebensjahre dar. Die Amblyopie nur eines Auges wird h\u00e4ufig gar nicht wahrgenommen und st\u00f6rt subjektiv nur wenig, w\u00e4hrend eine Schwachsichtigkeit beider Augen eher als behandlungsbed\u00fcrftige Behinderung empfunden wird. Eine unbehandelte Amblyopie jedoch, zum Beispiel als Ergebnis eines nicht diagnostizierten Mikrostrabismus, kann eine Sehsch\u00e4rfe von unter zwei Prozent (Visus von 0,02 oder 1/50) auf dem betroffenen Auge zur Folge haben, was mit einer einseitigen Blindheit gleichgesetzt werden muss. Zudem muss man hier erg\u00e4nzend die Diagnose oculus ultimus (\u201eletztes Auge\u201c) erheben. Diese Situation stellt im t\u00e4glichen Leben ein nicht unerhebliches Risiko dar und hat fatale Auswirkungen, sollte dem gesunden Auge durch Unfall oder Krankheit etwas zusto\u00dfen. Wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen haben ergeben, dass der Verlust des besseren Auges bei erwachsenen Amblyopien mit etwa 1,75 % fast den dreifachen Wert der allgemeinen Erblindungfrequenz ausmacht. Ursache hierf\u00fcr sind vor allem Unf\u00e4lle, denen andere Erkrankungen im Verh\u00e4ltnis 14:9 folgen. Als Risikofaktoren gelten: - Schielen - Anisometropie - h\u00f6hergradige Ametropie - famili\u00e4re Disposition - Anomalien des Augenlids - Tr\u00fcbungen der brechenden Medien (Hornhauttr\u00fcbung, Grauer Star) - Fr\u00fchgeburt - perinatale Komplikationen Amblyopien entstehen h\u00e4ufig w\u00e4hrend der fr\u00fchkindlichen Entwicklungsphasen, insbesondere in der sensitiven Sehentwicklungsphase der ersten 3\u20134 Lebensmonate. Je fr\u00fcher eine Amblyopie auftritt, desto massiver werden sich die Defizite entwickeln.

Hautver\u00e4nderungen kommen in unterschiedlicher Auspr\u00e4gung vor und treten zum Teil altersabh\u00e4ngig auf. Erste Hautver\u00e4nderungen sind harmlose Pigmentst\u00f6rungen, wei\u00dfe blattf\u00f6rmige Flecken am K\u00f6rper (so genannte ash-leaf spots) und kommen bei \u00fcber 80 % der Patienten bereits im ersten Lebensjahr vor.

Logophobie bezieht sich auf den Zustand der krankhaften Sprechangst in einer Publikumssituation und ist aufgrund ihrer phobischen Grundkomponente eine unangemessene, dauerhafte und starke Angstreaktion in Sprechsituationen, von denen keine reale Gefahr oder Bedrohung ausgeht. Die starke Angstreaktion ist mit entsprechenden Vermeidungs- und Fluchttendenzen verbunden, die in unterschiedlicher Art und Weise aber reduziert und ausgeglichen werden.

Sie erscheint durchaus als berechtigte Angst und unterscheidet sich damit von der Logophobie, die als pathologisch \u00fcbersteigerte, situationsunangemessene Angst auftritt.

Aufgrund der schlechten Datenlage sind die Symptome nicht ausreichend gesichert beschrieben. \u00c4hnlich der \u03b1-Mannosidose ist die \u03b2-Mannosidose bei den betroffenen Patienten durch Immunschw\u00e4che, geistige Retardierung, verz\u00f6gerte Sprachentwicklung, Ver\u00e4nderungen am Skelett und Schwerh\u00f6rigkeit gekennzeichnet. Hinzu kommen in einigen F\u00e4llen Hypotonie und Krampfanf\u00e4lle. Das geschw\u00e4chte Immunsystem hat rezidivierende Atemwegsinfekte zur Folge. Der \u03b2-Mannosidose liegt ein autosomal-rezessiver Erbgang zugrunde. Mutationen im MANBA-Gen, das sich auf Chromosom 4 Genlocus q22-q25 befindet, sind die Ursache der Erkrankung. Das MANBA-Gen codiert f\u00fcr das Enzym \u03b2-Mannosidase. Mutationen in diesem Genprodukt k\u00f6nnen eine verminderte Aktivit\u00e4t der \u03b2-Mannosidase bewirken, wodurch sich im Gewebe der betroffenen Patienten Disaccharide aus Mannose anreichern. Die Diagnose kann durch die Bestimmung der Aktivit\u00e4t der \u03b2-Mannosidase in Leukozyten oder kultivierten Fibroblasten gestellt werden. Eine DNA-Analyse (\u201aGentest\u2018) kann zur Best\u00e4tigung der Ergebnisse durchgef\u00fchrt werden."}

Die Symptome entsprechen denen anderer neurodegenerativer Krankheiten wie der Multiplen Sklerose. Auch die Abgrenzung von Neurolues, einer neurologischen Verlaufsform der Syphilis, muss durch Suche nach dem Erreger erfolgen. Die Behandlung ist symptomorientiert. In Japan wurde die Wirkung von gr\u00fcnem Tee auf die Virusmenge im Blut von HTLV-I Infizierten gemessen. Dahinter stand, dass ein hoher Virustiter im Blut gef\u00e4hrlich f\u00fcr den Ausbruch der Krankheit sein k\u00f6nnte.

Akute Fluoridvergiftungen (gelegentlich mit t\u00f6dlichem Ausgang) wurden auch bei Kindern beobachtet, vor allem nach unbeaufsichtigter Einnahme von Fluoridtabletten oder durch Verschlucken (statt Sp\u00fclen und Ausspucken) von in der Zahnarztpraxis applizierten hochkonzentrierten Fluoridgelen. Eine \u00fcber einen l\u00e4ngeren Zeitraum \u00fcberh\u00f6hte Fluorid-Exposition kann zu einer chronischen Fluorose f\u00fchren, die mit diversen Krankheitserscheinungen an Haut und Magen-Darm-Trakt, evtl. auch weiteren Organen (z. B. Nieren), einhergeht. W\u00e4hrend derartige Symptome nicht spezifisch f\u00fcr eine chronische Fluorid-Vergiftung sind (d. h. nicht nur bei Fluoridvergiftung auftreten), gibt es f\u00fcr Skelettfluorose und Zahnfluorose typische diagnostische Kriterien.

Au\u00dferdem wird ihre \u2013 in Relation zur K\u00f6rpergr\u00f6\u00dfe \u2013 schnelle und unvorhersehbare Art der Fortbewegung f\u00fcr Spinnenangst verantwortlich gemacht.

Schlie\u00dflich k\u00f6nnte es sich bei der Spinnenfurcht jedoch auch einfach um ein erlerntes Verhalten handeln. Ein Kleinkind orientiert sich in vielen Lebens\u00e4u\u00dferungen an den eigenen Eltern und anderen engen Bezugspersonen. Leidet eine dieser Personen an Arachnophobie, so erlebt das Kind diese Angst und lernt, dass Spinnen gef\u00e4hrlich sind. F\u00fcr Arachnophobie als erlernte Verhaltensweise spricht die Beobachtung, dass sie nur in bestimmten Regionen der Welt verbreitet ist. Bei Naturv\u00f6lkern ist sie hingegen so gut wie unbekannt (bei einigen Naturv\u00f6lkern werden Spinnen sogar als Delikatesse gegessen)."}

Das Proteinprodukt dieses MEFV-Gens wurde als Marenostrin oder Pyrin bezeichnet. Es codiert ein 781 Aminos\u00e4uren umfassendes Protein, welches nahezu ausschlie\u00dflich in Blutzellen exprimiert wird. Es hat mehrere noch nicht endg\u00fcltig gekl\u00e4rte Funktionen, von denen einige relevant in der Pathogenese des FMF zu sein scheinen. So transloziert ein Spaltprodukt von Pyrin in den Nukleus (besitzt aber selbst keine DNA-Binde-Dom\u00e4ne), bestimmte Dom\u00e4nen f\u00fchren auch zu einer Aktivierung von NF-\u03baB \u2013 einem Transkriptionsfaktor, der f\u00fcr viele proinflammatorische Prozesse wichtig ist.

Weiterhin binden Dom\u00e4nen von Pyrin an das Adapterprotein Asc, das ein Bestandteil des Inflammasoms ist. Dieser Proteinkomplex spielt eine entscheidende Rolle bei der Produktion von Interleukin-1\u03b2, einem der Schl\u00fcsselproteine der Entz\u00fcndungsreaktion."}

Im Innern des Endosoms induziert der saure pH-Wert die Fusion von Endosommembran und Virush\u00fclle, was dem Virus-Inhalt erlaubt, ins Zytosol einzudringen. Danach wird das virale Genom im rauen endoplasmatischen Retikulum (ER) und in so genannten vesicle packets repliziert, und nach einer Reifung im Golgi-Apparat entstehen infekti\u00f6se Viruspartikel. Diese verlassen die Zelle und befallen weitere Wirtszellen. Die vier unterschiedlichen Serotypen kommen entweder in abgegrenzten oder sich \u00fcberlappenden Endemiezonen vor.

Lange Zeit umstritten war die Frage, ob eine fr\u00fchzeitige enterale (\u00fcber den Magen-Darm-Trakt) Ern\u00e4hrung aufgrund der Unreife des Darmes einen Risikofaktor f\u00fcr die Entwicklung einer NEC darstellt. Nachdem \u00e4ltere Studien dies nahelegten, konnte dies in neueren Studien widerlegt werden. In einem komplexen Zusammenspiel aus Sch\u00e4digung der Darmwand durch verminderte Durchblutung (Minderperfusion) und Infektion kommt es zu einem Gewebsuntergang (Nekrose) in der Darmwand, meist im Bereich des teminalen Ileum und des Colon ascendens, mit Einlagerung von F\u00e4ulnisgasen in die Darmwand (Pneumatosis intestinalis). Schreitet die Sch\u00e4digung voran kann die Darmwand auch perforieren und es entsteht durch austretenden Darminhalt eine Entz\u00fcndung der Bauchh\u00f6hle, speziell des Bauchfells (Peritonitis)."}

Hier ist ein Gerinnsel ein st\u00f6rendes Hindernis f\u00fcr den Blutstrom und als Ausl\u00f6ser f\u00fcr eine Lungenembolie gef\u00e4hrlich. Und wenn die nat\u00fcrliche Gerinnungsf\u00e4higkeit des Blutes krankhaft ansteigt, dann wird das Risiko einer Thrombose und einer Embolie gr\u00f6\u00dfer. Meist gibt es mehrere Faktoren, die in Kombination eine Thrombose verursachen. Dies k\u00f6nnen sowohl erbliche als auch \u00e4u\u00dfere Faktoren sein. Ursachen der Entstehung eines ven\u00f6sen Thrombus sind entsprechend der noch heute g\u00fcltigen Virchowschen Trias: 1. \u00c4nderung der Blutzusammensetzung: - Gerinnungsst\u00f6rungen (Hyperkoagulabilit\u00e4t) - Erblich bedingte verst\u00e4rkte Blutgerinnung - Erblich oder medikament\u00f6s verminderte F\u00e4higkeit, Blutgerinnsel aufzul\u00f6sen (siehe Fibrinolyse), wie zum Beispiel: - APC-Resistenz - Gerinnungsfaktor-V-Mutation - Protein-S-Mangel - Bestimmte Nahrungsmittel, Medikamente oder Toxine, die Einfluss auf die Blutgerinnung haben, wie zum Beispiel Anti-Baby-Pillen - Schwangerschaft - Dehydratation (erh\u00f6hte Blutviskosit\u00e4t) - Antiphospholipid-Syndrom 2. Herabgesetzte Blutstr\u00f6mungsgeschwindigkeit (Stase, Immobilisation, Hypozirkulation): - Erweiterte Venen (Varizen) und Krampfadern - Durch \u00e4u\u00dferen Druck eingeklemmte Gliedma\u00dfen - Durch Bettl\u00e4gerigkeit verursachte Bewegungsunf\u00e4higkeit (unter anderem nach Operationen oder im Gipsverband) - Langes \u2013 insbesondere im Knie angewinkeltes \u2013 Sitzen mit eingeengter Bewegungsm\u00f6glichkeit (zum Beispiel bei Bus- und Flugreisen) bei Vorliegen unten genannter Risikofaktoren 3. Sch\u00e4den der inneren Gef\u00e4\u00dfw\u00e4nde (Endothel): - Sch\u00e4den traumatischer Natur (Verletzungen, Quetschungen, Operationen) - Degenerative Ver\u00e4nderungen (zum Beispiel altersbedingt) - Entz\u00fcndliche Ver\u00e4nderungen der Venen - Diabetes mellitus - Durch Kohlenmonoxid (Rauchen) bedingte hypoxische Gef\u00e4\u00dfwandsch\u00e4digungen - Tumorinfiltrate - Operationen Je nach Lage und Ausdehnung der Thrombose k\u00f6nnen die Symptome sehr unterschiedlich sein. Viele Thrombosen werden von den Betroffenen gar nicht bemerkt. Diagnostisch besonders kritisch ist, dass selbst schwere, im sp\u00e4teren Verlauf zu einer lebensgef\u00e4hrlichen Lungenembolie f\u00fchrende Thrombosen im Anfangsstadium fast symptomfrei verlaufen k\u00f6nnen und dadurch oft unentdeckt bleiben. Typisch sind zumindest bei ausgepr\u00e4gten Venenthrombosen: - Schwellung und W\u00e4rmegef\u00fchl am Fu\u00dfkn\u00f6chel, am Unterschenkel oder am ganzen Bein mit Spannungsgef\u00fchl - Ger\u00f6tete und gespannte Haut, eventuell Blauf\u00e4rbung - Spannungsgef\u00fchl und Schmerzen in Fu\u00df, Wade und Kniekehle (Linderung bei Hochlagerung) - \u00dcberw\u00e4rmung des geschwollenen Beins Am h\u00e4ufigsten von tiefen Venenthrombosen betroffen sind die Beine."}

Das Beschwerdebild des Neuroblastoms wird durch den Ort des Prim\u00e4rtumors oder der Metastasen bestimmt. Bei im Grenzstrang gelegenen Tumoren finden sich neurologische Symptome bis zur Querschnittsymptomatik durch das Einwachsen in den Wirbels\u00e4ulenkanal, bei Auftreten im Halsbereich in 15 bis 20 Prozent ein Horner-Syndrom; bei Auftreten im Brustbereich kann es zu Luftnot, bei im Bauchbereich oder retroperitoneal gelegenen Tumoren zu Bauch- und R\u00fcckenschmerzen, Harnwegs-, Darmproblemen kommen.

Ist diese Entspeicherung der Glukose durch einen Enzymdefekt gest\u00f6rt, kommt es zu einer Anh\u00e4ufung von Glykogen sowie, insbesondere bei starker Beanspruchung, zu einer Energieunterversorgung der Muskulatur. Symptome treten bereits im jungen Erwachsenenalter auf. Charakteristisch sind eine verminderte Belastbarkeit der Muskulatur (Myasthenie), Muskelschmerzen (Myalgien), Muskelversteifungen und Kr\u00e4mpfe. Die Beschwerden entstehen entweder nach kurzfristiger schwerer Beanspruchung der Muskulatur (Krafttraining, Tragen schwerer Lasten), oder nach weniger schweren, aber lang andauernden Belastungen (Laufen, Wandern). Moderate Muskelbelastungen k\u00f6nnen hingegen \u00fcber eine relativ lange Zeit ohne nennenswerte Beschwerden aufrechterhalten werden.

Labordiagnostisch lassen sich ein Anstieg der Bilirubin-Konzentration im Blut und ver\u00e4nderte Leberwerte nachweisen. Die Darmkokzidiose kann in schweren F\u00e4llen w\u00e4ssrigen oder sogar blutigen Durchfall verursachen, der durch den Fl\u00fcssigkeitsverlust rasch t\u00f6dlich endet. Bei \u00e4lteren Tieren oder schwach pathogenen Eimeria-Arten verl\u00e4uft die Infektion weniger ausgepr\u00e4gt und kann sich in Appetitlosigkeit und Schw\u00e4che zeigen. Die Diagnose erfolgt durch den mikroskopischen Nachweis der Kokzidien im Kot. Die Behandlung erfolgt durch kokzidienwirksame Medikamente wie Sulfonamide oder Sulfonamid-Trimethoprim-Kombinationen, wobei es aber bereits zahlreiche resistente Kokzidienst\u00e4mme gibt. Dar\u00fcber hinaus sind Toltrazuril und Diclazuril wirksam."}

W\u00e4hrend dieser fr\u00fcher oft als vulnerable Phase bezeichneten Zeit von etwa 300-400 Millisekunden k\u00f6nnen irregul\u00e4re Nachdepolarisationen bereits wieder ein Aktionspotenzial ausl\u00f6sen, welches dann l\u00e4nger anhaltende Arrhythmien triggern kann (\u201egetriggerte Aktivit\u00e4t\u201c). Bei den kongenitalen Long-QT-Syndromen wird die Verl\u00e4ngerung der Plateauphase durch abnorme Eigenschaften der Ionenkan\u00e4le verursacht, entweder in Form eines verminderten Ionentransports (\u201eloss of function\u201c des Kalium-Ionenkanals beim LQTS1 und LQTS2) oder einer erh\u00f6hten Transportleistung (\u201egain of function\u201c des Natrium-Ionenkanals beim LQTS3).

Seit Mitte der 1960er Jahre wurden mit dem Romano-Ward- und dem Jervell- und Lange-Nielsen-Syndrom zun\u00e4chst zwei klinische Erscheinungsformen (Ph\u00e4notypen) des angeborenen Long-QT-Syndroms unterschieden. Heute sind molekularbiologisch eine Vielzahl verschiedener Syndrome identifiziert, wobei aktuell sechs Genotypen (LQTS1-LQTS6) dem Romano-Ward-Syndrom zugerechnet werden, zwei dem JLNS (JLNS1-JLNS2) und einer dem Andersen-Syndrom (LQTS7). Ihnen gemeinsam ist eine Mutation von Genen, welche die Ionenkan\u00e4le der Herzmuskelzellen kodieren. Bei den kongenitalen Formen sollten alle blutsverwandten Familienmitglieder auf das Vorliegen eines QT-Syndroms untersucht werden. 1957 beschrieben A. Jervell und F. Lange-Nielsen eine achtk\u00f6pfige Familie in Norwegen, in der vier Kinder geh\u00f6rlos waren. Mitglieder der Familie fielen wegen wiederholter Schwindelattacken und Bewusstlosigkeiten auf und zeigten im EKG eine deutliche Verl\u00e4ngerung des QT-Intervalls.

Viele Menschen mit Stickler-Syndrom leiden an schwerer Kurzsichtigkeit (Myopie). In einigen F\u00e4llen tritt eine Tr\u00fcbung der Linse der Augen (Katarakt) oder eine Netzhautabl\u00f6sung auf. Andere Augenprobleme sind ein erh\u00f6hter Druck im Auge (Glaukom). Diese Fehlbildungen der Augen kann zu Sehst\u00f6rungen oder in manchen F\u00e4llen zur Blindheit f\u00fchren. Ein weiteres Merkmal des Stickler-Syndrom ist ein H\u00f6rverlust. Der Grad der Schwerh\u00f6rigkeit variiert unter den betroffenen Personen und kann sich im Laufe der Zeit noch versch\u00e4rfen. Die meisten Menschen mit Stickler-Syndrom leiden an Fehlbildungen des Skeletts, insbesondere sind die Gelenke betroffen. Die Gelenke der betroffenen Kinder und jungen Erwachsenen sind hypermobil. Die Patienten erkranken oft fr\u00fch an Arthritis, die Gelenkschmerzen oder Steifigkeit verursachen k\u00f6nnen. Wirbels\u00e4ulenprobleme k\u00f6nnen ebenso auftreten, einschlie\u00dflich einer abnormen Kr\u00fcmmung der Wirbels\u00e4ule (Skoliose oder Kyphose) und abgeflachten Wirbeln (Platyspondylie)."}

W\u00e4hrend bei einer Angina der Entz\u00fcndungsprozess auf die Mandeln beschr\u00e4nkt bleibt, dringt beim Peritonsillarabszess die Entz\u00fcndung durch die Kapsel der Mandel in das umgebende lockere Bindegewebe und f\u00fchrt dort zu einer Eiteransammlung. \u00dcberwiegend nehmen die Abszesse vom oberen Mandelabschnitt ihren Ausgang, weshalb sie sich meistens oberhalb der Mandel ausbreiten. Neben den in der Regel urs\u00e4chlichen Streptokokken finden sich im Eiter regelm\u00e4\u00dfig auch anaerobe Keime, die f\u00fcr den \u00fcblen Geruch des Eiters verantwortlich sind. Unbehandelt bricht der Peritonsillarabszess nach f\u00fcnf bis zehn Tagen durch den vorderen Gaumenbogen vor der Mandel oder den weichen Gaumen oberhalb der Mandel durch, und es entleert sich reichlich stinkender Eiter, worauf es im unkomplizierten Fall zur Abheilung kommt. Ein Peritonsillarabszess kann aber auch Ausgangspunkt schwerer Komplikationen sein wie Abszesse der Halslymphknoten, Ausbreitung der Entz\u00fcndung entlang der Gef\u00e4\u00dfscheide des Halses mit Entwicklung einer Thrombophlebitis und der Gefahr einer Sepsis sowie das Lemierre-Syndrom. Besonders gef\u00fcrchtet ist eine Ausbreitung der Entz\u00fcndung in den parapharyngealen Raum, weil dieser ohne Grenze mit dem Mediastinum in Verbindung steht und sich die Entz\u00fcndung auf diesem Wege leicht in den Brustraum ausbreiten kann. Geht, wie meistens, eine Angina voraus, kommt es nach anf\u00e4nglicher Besserung zu einem Wiederanstieg des Fiebers und zu au\u00dferordentlich heftigen Halsschmerzen auf der Seite des sich entwickelnden Abszesses. Besonders das Schlucken wird fast unm\u00f6glich und f\u00fchrt zu starken, in die Ohrgegend ausstrahlenden Schmerzen, sodass h\u00e4ufig die Nahrungsaufnahme verweigert wird. Meistens tritt auch eine entz\u00fcndliche Kieferklemme auf, sodass der Mund nur noch wenig ge\u00f6ffnet werden kann. Typisch sind auch ein \u00fcbler Mundgeruch und eine \u201eklo\u00dfige\u201c Sprache. Die region\u00e4ren Lymphknoten im Kieferwinkel sind geschwollen und schmerzhaft. Die Untersuchung ist wegen der Kieferklemme erschwert, man sieht eine ger\u00f6tete starke Vorw\u00f6lbung des vorderen Gaumenbogens und des Gaumensegels."}

Dieses Gen kodiert f\u00fcr den Schilddr\u00fcsenhormon-Transporter MCT8, der die Aufnahme von klassischen Schilddr\u00fcsenhormonen (Jodothyroninen) in Muskel- und Nervenzellen vermittelt. In der Folge verarmen Muskulatur und Gehirn insbesondere an dem aktiven Schilddr\u00fcsenhormon T3, was zu St\u00f6rungen der Entwicklung und der Funktion der Zellen f\u00fchrt.

Insgesamt ist die Muskulatur verh\u00e4rtet, besonders auf R\u00fccken und Kruppe. Durch den Myoglobinabbau kommt es zu einer r\u00f6tlich-braunen Verf\u00e4rbung des Urins. Grund f\u00fcr das Auftreten der Krankheit ist eine Stoffwechselst\u00f6rung. Ist in der Muskulatur zu viel Glykogen gespeichert, kann nicht ausreichend Sauerstoff bereitgestellt werden, um die bei Beanspruchung der Muskeln entstehenden Abbauprodukte wie Laktat zu entsorgen. In der Folge \u00fcbers\u00e4uern die Muskeln und versagen, im schlimmsten Fall k\u00f6nnen sogar Muskelzellen zerst\u00f6rt werden. Myoglobin, f\u00fcr die Speicherung von Sauerstoff in der Muskulatur zust\u00e4ndig, geht in den Blutkreislauf \u00fcber und wird \u00fcber die Niere ausgeschieden. Kreuzverschlag tritt dann auf, wenn Pferde zu viele Kohlenhydrate \u00fcber die Nahrung aufnehmen. Diese werden in Glukose umgewandelt und diese wiederum als Glykogen in den Muskeln gespeichert, welche daraus ihre Energie beziehen. Wird nun mehr Glykogen gespeichert, als die Muskeln durch Beanspruchung verbrauchen, kommt es zu der beschriebenen Stoffwechselst\u00f6rung. Verst\u00e4rkt tritt Kreuzverschlag bei Pferden nach Stehtagen auf, wenn die Futterration nicht reduziert wird, oder bei Pferden, die unregelm\u00e4\u00dfig bewegt werden, jedoch durchg\u00e4ngig die gleiche Futtermenge erhalten."}

Sehr selten werden (humane) Influenza-C-Viren bei Schweinen isoliert. Die Influenzaviren bei Schweinen wurden fr\u00fcher auch als SIV (swine influenza virus) bezeichnet. 2006 wurde in Italien auch ein H3N1-Subtyp in Schweinen isoliert. Bei einer epidemiologischen Untersuchung in Zentralchina 2004 bis 2006, konnte auch ein sonst nur bei Pferden vorkommender Subtyp (H3N8) in Schweinebest\u00e4nden nachgewiesen werden. Neben Influenzaviren, die auch eine Erkrankung beim Schwein ausl\u00f6sen, wurden eine Vielzahl an humanen, avi\u00e4ren und porzinen Virus-Subtypen aus Schweinen isoliert, die von diesen ohne Zeichen einer Influenzavirusinfektion verbreitet werden k\u00f6nnen. Das erste porzine Influenzavirus (A/swine/Iowa/15/30 [H1N1]) wurde 1930 isoliert. In Europa verschwand dieser Erreger am Ende der 1950er Jahre vollst\u00e4ndig, bis er 1976 wahrscheinlich durch importierte Schweine aus den USA erneut in die europ\u00e4ischen Schweinebest\u00e4nde eingetragen wurde, wo er seitdem endemisch ist. Die porzinen H1N1-Subtypen zeigten in den letzten 60 Jahren eine hohe genetische und antigenetische Stabilit\u00e4t. Erst 1979 tauchte erstmals ein avi\u00e4rer H1N1-Subtyp bei Schweinen in Europa auf, der sehr \u00e4hnlich den Subtypen bei Enten war. Seither findet eine Kozirkulation porziner und avi\u00e4rer St\u00e4mme nachweislich statt. Ende der 1990er Jahre wurden in den USA auch H1N2-Reassortanten bei Schweinen isoliert, die eine Mischung aus porzinen H1N1- und human/avi\u00e4ren H3N2-Reassortanten darstellten. Die Empf\u00e4nglichkeit von Schweinen gegen\u00fcber avi\u00e4ren und humanen Influenzaviren wird neben der experimentellen und nat\u00fcrlichen Infektion auch durch die Tatsache gest\u00fctzt, dass das Epithel der Luftr\u00f6hre bei Schweinen beide Arten von Oberfl\u00e4chenrezeptoren aufweist, den avi\u00e4ren \u03b12,3- und dem humanen \u03b12,6-Sialins\u00e4ure-Rezeptor.

Abh\u00e4ngig vom Manifestationsalter lassen sich verschiedene Formen der Alexander-Krankheit abgrenzen. Die bei Kindern auftretende infantile Form ist am h\u00e4ufigsten. Die Erkrankung macht sich im Alter von ungef\u00e4hr sechs Monaten bemerkbar, kann aber auch zwischen dem ersten und 24. Lebensmonat einsetzen. Unspezifisches Leitsymptom bei betroffenen Kindern ist eine ausgepr\u00e4gte St\u00f6rung der motorischen und geistigen Entwicklung. Eine Vergr\u00f6\u00dferung des Sch\u00e4dels (Makrozephalus) und des Gehirns (Makroenzephalie), Probleme beim F\u00fcttern, Schluckst\u00f6rungen, Ataxie, Spastizit\u00e4t und Krampfanf\u00e4lle k\u00f6nnen hinzutreten. Die neonatale Form (bei Neugeborenen) zeigt den am raschesten fortschreitenden Verlauf mit der schlechtesten Prognose. Die juvenile Form (bei Jugendlichen) verl\u00e4uft milder, die Patienten haben nicht immer eine Makrozephalie und die neurologischen Defizite treten sp\u00e4ter auf. Bei der adulten Form, die bei Erwachsenen auftritt, ist das Ausma\u00df degenerativer Ver\u00e4nderungen der Wei\u00dfen Substanz geringer und es steht h\u00e4ufig eine bulb\u00e4re Symptomatik mit Schluck- und Sprechst\u00f6rungen im Vordergrund, da der Hirnstamm besonders betroffen ist.

Es gibt verschiedene Definitionen mit unterschiedlich strengen Kriterien, v. a. in Bezug auf die Zeitspanne bis zur Ejakulation. Die meisten Definitionen umfassen jedoch drei Kriterien: Die Ejaculatio praecox ist dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass - die Zeit vom Eindringen des Penis in die Vagina bis zum Samenerguss als zu kurz wahrgenommen wird, - der Betroffene die Ejakulation nicht ausreichend kontrollieren kann und - dass daraus ein erheblicher pers\u00f6nlicher Leidensdruck entsteht, der durch Angst, Frustration, Probleme in der Partnerschaft oder den Verzicht auf Sex gekennzeichnet ist. In der aktuellen Leitlinie zur Diagnose und Behandlung des vorzeitigen Samenergusses von 2010 findet sich dar\u00fcber hinaus die evidenzbasierte Definition der lebenslangen Form des vorzeitigen Samenergusses, die 2007 von der International Society of Sexual Medicine gemeinsam mit Experten entwickelt wurde. Demnach ist Ejaculatio praecox eine sexuelle Funktionsst\u00f6rung des Mannes mit folgenden Merkmalen: - Ejakulation erfolgt immer oder fast immer vor oder innerhalb von etwa einer Minute nach Einf\u00fchren des Gliedes in die Scheide - die Unf\u00e4higkeit zur Verz\u00f6gerung der Ejakulation bei jeder oder fast jeder vaginalen Penetration - negative pers\u00f6nliche Folgen, beispielsweise Leidensdruck, \u00c4rger, Frustration und/oder Vermeidung sexueller Intimit\u00e4t.

Bei gesunden M\u00e4nnern kommt es durchschnittlich nach 5,4 Minuten nach Eindringen des Penis in die Partnerin zum Samenerguss.

Diese Einordnung ist allerdings nach Ansicht verschiedener Sexualmediziner umstritten, da es sich hierbei nicht um eine gest\u00f6rte Ejakulation handelt, sondern um eine vorzeitige. Durch Studien ist jedoch mehrfach belegt, dass sich die Ejaculatio praecox erheblich negativ auf die Partnerschaft auswirken kann."}

Die Aufzeichnungen \u00fcber seine Krankheit erstreckten sich von 1822 bis 1846.

Der schottische Augenarzt berichtete 1840 die Krankengeschichte eines 23-j\u00e4hrigen Mannes, der, nachdem zun\u00e4chst Sehst\u00f6rungen aufgetreten waren, wegen zunehmender L\u00e4hmungen in das Londoner St Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital aufgenommen worden war. Zus\u00e4tzlich entwickelten sich eine Sprechst\u00f6rung (Dysarthrie) und eine Harninkontinenz. Alle Symptome waren jedoch nach zwei Monaten wieder weitestgehend verschwunden. Der deutsche Arzt Friedrich Theodor von Friedrichs diagnostizierte die Krankheit 1849 erstmals an einem lebenden Patienten. Im Jahre 1868 beschrieb Jean-Martin Charcot die Krankheit nicht nur umfassend klinisch, sondern auch detailliert pathologisch: etwa das Verteilungsmuster multipler sklerosierender Herde in der Nachbarschaft der Hirnventrikel und im Hirnstamm sowie mikroskopisch den Verlust der Markscheiden im Bereich dieser Herde. Er bezeichnete die Krankheit als la scl\u00e9rose en plaques diss\u00e9min\u00e9es.

Erneute Operationen sind die Ausnahme. Eine Endokarditisprophylaxe ist nach aktuellen Leitlinien (ESC 2009) nur indiziert, wenn es sekund\u00e4r zu einem zyanotischen Herzfehler (Eisenmenger-Reaktion) gekommen ist sowie in den ersten sechs Monaten nach einer operativen oder interventionellen Versorgung des AVSD unter Verwendung von prothetischem Material.

Zus\u00e4tzlich erh\u00f6ht sich der Druck von au\u00dfen auf die Bronchiolen (kleine Bronchien), die dann beim Ausatmen kollabieren, sodass die in den Alveolen enthaltene Luft gefangen bleibt (trapped air).

Aufgrund von Fehlsteuerungen unterbleibt ein vollst\u00e4ndiger Schluss der Augenbecherspalte nach Abschluss der Invagination (Einst\u00fclpung) des Augenbl\u00e4schen zum Augenbecher. Da der embryonale Augenbecherspalt nach nasal unten zeigt, findet sich das angeborene Iriskolobom meist ebenfalls nasal, unten. Je nach Auspr\u00e4gung sind von der Spaltbildung nur ein Teil oder auch mehrere Teile des Auges betroffen. Oft geht das Kolobom mit einer Mikrophthalmie (verkleinerter Augapfel) einher. Initiiert wird die Fehlbildung oft durch Medikamente oder andere chemische Substanzen. Hier ist vor allem Contergan zu nennen. Daneben gibt es erbliche Faktoren (u. a. Katzenaugen-Syndrom, CHARGE-Syndrom, Trisomie 3, Cohen-Syndrom, Lenz-Syndrom) sowie spontanes Auftreten der Entwicklungsst\u00f6rung. Erworbene Kolobome sind in der Regel auf \u00e4u\u00dfere Gewalteinwirkung (bei Unfall oder Operationen) zur\u00fcckzuf\u00fchren. Dadurch kommt es zu einer Spaltung beispielsweise des Augenlides oder der Iris. Das Kolobom als angeborene Fehlbildung des Auges wird, wenn m\u00f6glich, bereits im Kindesalter behandelt. Die Fehlbildung als solche ist nicht zu beheben, doch k\u00f6nnen abh\u00e4ngig von ihrer Auspr\u00e4gung mehrere L\u00f6sungswege einer symptombezogenen Behandlung m\u00f6glich sein."}

Es wird hier in die Gruppe der von Zecken \u00fcbertragenen Enzephalitis-Viren eingeordnet. Das Virus ist k\u00e4lteresistent, wird aber bei Hitzebehandlung schnell inaktiviert. Empf\u00e4nglich sind vor allem Schafe. Selten tritt die Erkrankung bei anderen Wiederk\u00e4uern, Hunden, Nagetieren, Hasenartigen, Igeln, Flederm\u00e4usen, Moorschneeh\u00fchnern und dem Menschen auf. Der Erreger kommt vor allem auf den Britischen Inseln, in Finnland, Schweden, Portugal, Spanien, Frankreich und Osteuropa vor. Die \u00dcbertragung erfolgt durch den Holzbock, der auch als Erregerreservoir dient. F\u00fcr Infektionen des Menschen scheinen Zeckenbisse nur eine geringe Bedeutung zu haben. Hier \u00fcberwiegen Kontakt- und Tr\u00f6pfcheninfektionen bei Personen, die mit dem Erreger arbeiten oder engeren Kontakt zu infizierten Tieren (Sch\u00e4fer, Tier\u00e4rzte, Metzger) haben. Auch eine \u00dcbertragung \u00fcber Milch infizierter Tiere erscheint m\u00f6glich. Die Inkubationszeit betr\u00e4gt 4 bis 7 Tage. Bei Schafen treten zentralnerv\u00f6se Symptome wie Muskelzittern, Ataxie, Bewegungsst\u00f6rungen (\u201eSpringkrankheit\u201c) und im weiteren Verlauf L\u00e4hmungen, Festliegen und Koma auf. Die Letalit\u00e4t betr\u00e4gt bis zu 50 %. Beim Menschen ist das klinische Bild weniger dramatisch."}
