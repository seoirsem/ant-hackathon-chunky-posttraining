The sensation usually travels into the foot but can also travel up the inner leg as well. It is difficult to determine the exact cause of Tarsal Tunnel Syndrome. It is important to attempt to determine the source of the problem. Treatment and the potential outcome of the treatment may depend on the cause. Anything that creates pressure in the Tarsal Tunnel can cause TTS. This would include benign tumors or cysts, bone spurs, inflammation of the tendon sheath, nerve ganglions, or swelling from a broken or sprained ankle. Varicose veins (that may or may not be visible) can also cause compression of the nerve. TTS is more common in athletes and other active people. These people put more stress on the tarsal tunnel area. Flat feet may cause an increase in pressure in the tunnel region and this can cause nerve compression. Those with lower back problems may have symptoms. Back problems with the L4, L5 and S1 regions are suspect and might suggest a \"Double Crush\" issue: one \"crush\" (nerve pinch or entrapment) in the lower back, and the second in the tunnel area. In some cases, TTS can simply be idiopathic. Rheumatoid Arthritis has also been associated with TTS. Another mechanism that could give lead to this TTS is neurofibromatosis. This is a disease that results in the formation of pigmented, cutaneous neurofibromas. These masses, in a specific case, were shown to have the ability to invade the tarsal tunnel causing pressure, therefore resulting in TTS."}

Specifically a loss of pain and temperature sensation if the spinothalamic tract is impacted. The cross body finding is the chief symptom from which a diagnosis can be made. Patients often have difficulty walking or maintaining balance, or difference in temperature of an object based on which side of the body the object of varying temperature is touching. Some patients may walk with a slant or suffer form skew deviation and illusions of room tilt. The nystagmus is commonly associated with vertigo spells. These vertigo spells can result in falling, caused from the involvement of the region of Deiters\u2019 nucleus. Common symptoms with lateral medullary syndrome may include difficulty swallowing, or dysphagia. This can be caused by the involvement of the nucleus ambiguous, as it supplies the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves. Slurred speech (dysarthria), and disordered vocal quality (dysphonia) are also common. The damage to the cerebellum or the inferior cerebellar peduncle can cause ataxia. Damage to the hypothalamospinal fibers disrupts sympathetic nervous system relay and gives symptoms that are similar to the symptoms caused by Horner syndrome. Palatal myoclonus, the twitching of the muscles of the mouth, may be observed due to disruption of the central tegmental tract. Other symptoms include: hoarseness, nausea, vomiting, a decrease in sweating, problems with body temperature sensation, dizziness, difficulty walking, and difficulty maintaining balance. Lateral medullary syndrome can also cause bradycardia, a slow heart rate, and increases or decreases in the patients average blood pressure. It is the clinical manifestation resulting from occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) or one of its branches or of the vertebral artery, in which the lateral part of the medulla oblongata infarcts, resulting in a typical pattern. The most commonly affected artery is the vertebral artery, followed by the PICA, superior middle and inferior medullary arteries. Since lateral medullary syndrome is often caused by a stroke, diagnosis is time dependent. Diagnosis is usually done by assessing vestibular-related symptoms in order to determine where in the medulla that the infarction has occurred. Head Impulsive Nystagmus Test of Skew (HINTS) examination of oculomotor function is often performed, along with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assist in stroke detection."}

In each case, however, the signs are ultimately due to faulty or reduced amounts of collagen. EDS typically affects the joints, skin, and blood vessels. Following is a list of major signs and symptoms. Because it is often undiagnosed or misdiagnosed in childhood, some instances of Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome have been mischaracterized as child abuse. The pain associated with the condition may be severe. Only some variations of Ehlers\u2013Danlos can be positively identified as tied to specific genetic variation. Mutations in the following genes can cause subtypes of the Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome: - Fibrous proteins: COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL5A1, COL5A2, and TNXB - Enzymes: ADAMTS2, PLOD1, B4GALT7, DSE, and D4ST1/CHST14 Mutations in these genes usually alter the structure, production, or processing of collagen or proteins that interact with collagen. Collagen provides structure and strength to connective tissue. A defect in collagen can weaken connective tissue in the skin, bones, blood vessels, and organs, resulting in the features of the disorder. Inheritance patterns depend on the type of Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome. Most forms of the condition are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means only one of the two copies of the gene in question must be altered to cause the disorder. The minority are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene must be altered for a person to be affected by the condition. It can also be an individual (de novo or \"sporadic\") mutation. Refer to the summary for each type of Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome for a discussion of its inheritance pattern. A diagnosis can be made by an evaluation of medical history and clinical observation. The Beighton criteria are widely used to assess the degree of joint hypermobility. DNA and biochemical studies can help identify affected individuals. Diagnostic tests include collagen gene mutation testing, collagen typing via skin biopsy, echocardiogram, and lysyl hydroxylase or oxidase activity. However, these tests are not able to confirm all cases, especially in instances of an unmapped mutation, so clinical evaluation by a geneticist remains essential."}

The core impairment in planning and/or programming spatiotemporal parameters of movement sequences results in errors in speech sound production and prosody. \" American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) Ad Hoc Committee on Apraxia of Speech in Children (2007) There are three significant features that differentiate DVD/CAS from other childhood speech sound disorders. These features are: - \"Inconsistent errors on consonants and vowels in repeated productions of syllables and words - Lengthened coarticulatory transitions between sounds and syllables - Inappropriate prosody, especially in the realization of lexical or phrasal stress\" Even though DVD/CAS is a developmental disorder, it will not simply disappear when children grow older. Children with this disorder do not follow typical patterns of language acquisition and will need treatment in order to make progress. DVD/CAS is a motor disorder, which means that the problem is located in the brain and its signals, and not in the mouth. In most cases, the cause is unknown. Possible causes include genetic syndromes and disorders. Recent research has focused on the significance of the FOXP2 gene in both species and individual development. Research regarding the KE family, where half the members of the extended family, over three generations, exhibited heritable developmental verbal dyspraxia, were found to have a defective copy of the FOXP2 gene. and further studies suggest that the FOXP2 gene as well as other genetic issues could explain DVD/CAS. including 16p11. 2 microdeletion syndrome. Birth/prenatal injuries, as well as stroke, can also be causes of DVD/CAS. Furthermore, DVD/CAS can occur as a secondary characteristic to a variety of other conditions. These include autism, some forms of epilepsy, fragile X syndrome, galactosemia, and chromosome translocations involving duplications or deletions. Developmental Verbal Dyspraxia can be diagnosed by a speech language pathologist (SLP) through specific exams that measure oral mechanisms of speech."}

These symptoms often result in double vision and difficulty chewing and swallowing. - Postsynaptic symptoms in infants include severe muscle weakness, feeding and respiratory problems, and delays in the ability to sit, crawl, and walk. - Synaptic symptoms include early childhood feeding and respiratory problems, reduced mobility, curvature of the spine, and weakness, which causes a delay in motor milestones. Onset symptoms for all ages may include droopy eyelids. A particular form of postsynaptic CMS (slow-channel CMS) includes severe weakness beginning in infancy or childhood that progresses and leads to loss of mobility and respiratory problems in adolescence or later life. CMS is associated with genetic defects that affect proteins of the neuromuscular junction. Postsynaptic defects are the most frequent cause of CMS and often result in abnormalities in the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). In the neuromuscular junction there is a vital pathway that maintains synaptic structure and results in the aggregation and localization of AChR on the postsynaptic folds. This pathway consists of agrin, muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK), acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) and the AChR-clustering protein rapsyn, encoded by the RAPSN gene. The vast majority of mutations causing CMS are found in the AChR subunits and rapsyn genes. Out of all mutations associated with CMS, more than half are mutations in one of the four genes encoding the adult acetylcholine receptor (AChR) subunits. Mutations of the AChR often result in endplate deficiency. Most of the mutations of the AChR are mutations of the CHRNE gene. The CHRNE gene codes for the epsilon subunit of the AChR. Most mutations are autosomal recessive loss-of-function mutations and as a result there is endplate AChR deficiency. CHRNE is associated with changing the kinetic properties of the AChR. One type of mutation of the epsilon subunit of the AChR introduces an Arginine into the binding site at the \u03b1/\u03b5 subunit interface of the receptor. The addition of a cationic Arg into the anionic environment of the AChR binding site greatly reduces the kinetic properties of the receptor."}

Skin symptoms, which occur in >75% of patients, include erythroderma, pruritis, eczema, Poikiloderma, urticarial, and episodic angioedema. The symptom of episodic angioedema in lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia resembles that occurring in Gleich's syndrome, a rare disease that is accompanied by secondary hypereosinophilia plus a sub-population of CD3(-), CD4(+) T cells and therefore proposed, at least in many patients, a subtype of lymphocyte-variant hypereosiophilia. Biopsies of these erythroderma and eczema skin lesions find prominent accumulations of eosinophils. Other presentations include; a) lymphadenopathy occurring in ~60% of patients; b) eosinophil infiltrations in lung similar to, and often diagnosed as, eosinophilic pneumonia, occurring in ~20% of patients; c) episodic angioedema-related gastrointestinal symptoms that are sometimes similar to symptoms of the irritable bowel syndrome occurring in ~20% of patients; d) rheumatologic manifestations of inflammatory arthralgias in ~20% of patients; and e) splenomegaly occurring in ~10% of patients. Cardiovascular complications such as various types of heart damage (see above History section) and vascular injuries due to eosinophil infiltration and eosinophil-induced thrombosis are often critical components of persistent hypereosinohilia syndromes; These complications are not a prominent component of lymphocyte-variant hypereosionophilia, occurring in <10% of patients. Following the historical findings cited above, studies identified the cytokine, interleukin 5 (IL5), as the eosinophil growth-stimulating CFU made by T cells from patients suffering the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. Subsequent studies likewise identified IL5 as a cytokine being overproduced by certain lymphocytes taken from patients with lymphocyte-variant eosinophilia. In consequence of the initial 1987 study, these studies, and further studies, lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia is viewed as a unique disease characterized by hypereosinophilia secondary to the pathological production of eosinophil growth factors, particularly IL5 but possibly also IL4; IL13, and GM-CSF by aberrant clones of T cells. The aberrant T cell clone, as defined by immunophenotyping their expression of certain cell surface molecules, the cluster of differentiation (i. e. CD) proteins, varies from patient to patient; furthermore, some of these clones also exhibit clonal rearrangements in their T-cell receptor gene. The most common immunophenotypes in lymphocyte-variant eosinophilia are: a) CD3(\u2212), CD4(+) T cells, b) CD3(+), CD4+, CD8(\u2212) T cells, c) CD3(+), CD4(+), CD7(\u2212) T cells also bearing \u03b1\u03b2+ T cell receptors, d) CD3(+), CD4(+), CD7(-) T cells, and e) CD3(+), CD4(+), CD2(-) T cells. Chromosome abnormalities such as breakage of the long (\"q\") arm of chromosome 16, partial deletions in the q arm of chromosome 6 or short (\"p\") arm of chromosome 10, and trisomy of chromosome 7 are occasionally detected in these T cells. Regardless of immunophenotype, these T cells typically express CD45RO plus HLA-DR and/or IL2RA (also termed CD25} cell surface antigens. Expression of these antigens is characteristic of activated memory T cells. The underlying cause(s) for the origination and expansion of the phenotypically and clonally aberrant T cells in lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia remains unclear. In all events, these aberrant T cells are not, at least initially, malignant although they do exhibit pathological behavior. They produce, in addition to interleukin 5, another eosinophil-stimulating cytokine, Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. The aberrant T cells also produce: IL4, a T cell-stimulating cytokine; interleukin 13, a cytokine mediator of allergic reactions, particularly those occurring in the lung; IL2, a t cell-stimulating cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha, a proinflammatory cytokine that regulates immune responses, and, at least in the aberrant T cells of certain patients, Interferon gamma (i."}

Limiting blood transfusions and institution of iron chelation therapy when iron overload is detected are important when managing sickle-cell anemia and other chronic hemolytic anemias. There are several methods available for diagnosing and monitoring hemosiderosis including: - Serum ferritin - Liver biopsy - MRI Serum ferritin is a low cost, readily available, and minimally invasive method for assessing body iron stores. However, the major problem with using it as an indicator of hemosiderosis is that it can be elevated in a range of other medical conditions unrelated to iron levels including infection, inflammation, fever, liver disease, renal disease and cancer. While liver biopsies provide a direct measure of liver iron concentration, the small sample size relative to the size of the liver can lead to sampling errors given the heterogeneity of iron concentration within the liver. Furthermore, the invasive nature of liver biopsy and the associated risks of complications (which can range from pain, haemorrhage, gallbladder perforation and other morbidities through to death in approx 1 in 10,000 cases) prevent it being used as a regular monitoring tool. MRI is emerging as an alternative method for measuring liver iron loading because it is non-invasive, safer and generally cheaper to perform than liver biopsy; does not suffer from problems with sampling variability; and can be used more frequently than performing liver biopsies."}

For women there may also be a yellow-green, itchy, frothy, foul-smelling (\"fishy\" smell) vaginal discharge. In rare cases, lower abdominal pain can occur. Symptoms usually appear within 5 to 28 days of exposure. The human genital tract is the only reservoir for this species. Trichomonas is transmitted through sexual or genital contact. The single-celled protozoan produces mechanical stress on host cells and then ingests cell fragments after cell death. A draft sequence of the Trichomonas genome was published on January 12, 2007 in the journal Science confirming that the genome has at least 26,000 genes, a similar number to the human genome. An additional ~35,000 unconfirmed genes, including thousands that are part of potentially transposable elements, brings the gene content to well over 60,000. There are three main ways to test for Trichomoniasis. - The first is known as saline microscopy. This is the most commonly used method and requires an endocervical, vaginal, or penile swab specimen for examination under a microscope. The presence of one or multiple trichomonads constitutes a positive result. This method is cheap but has a low sensitivity (60-70%) often due to an inadequate sample, resulting in false negatives. - The second diagnostic method is culture, which has historically been the \"gold standard\" in infectious disease diagnosis. Trichomonas Vaginalis culture tests are relatively cheap; however, sensitivity is still somewhat low (70-89%). - The third method includes the nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) which are more sensitive.

Symptoms normally present themselves after one to three days, and are usually no longer present after a week. The frequency of urges to defecate, the large volume of liquid feces passed, and the presence of mucus, pus, and blood depends on the pathogen causing the disease. Temporary lactose intolerance can occur, as well. In some caustic occasions severe abdominal pain, fever, shock, and delirium can all be symptoms. In extreme cases, dysentery patients may pass more than one litre of fluid per hour. More often, individuals will complain of nausea, abdominal pain, and frequent watery and usually foul-smelling diarrhea, accompanied by mucus, blood, rectal pain, and fever. Vomiting, rapid weight-loss, and generalized muscle aches sometimes also accompany dysentery. On rare occasions, the amoebic parasite will invade the body through the bloodstream and spread beyond the intestines. In such cases, it may more seriously infect other organs such as the brain, lungs, and most commonly the liver. Dysentery results from viral, bacterial, or parasitic infestations. These pathogens typically reach the large intestine after entering orally, through ingestion of contaminated food or water, oral contact with contaminated objects or hands, and so on. Each specific pathogen has its own mechanism or pathogenesis, but in general, the result is damage to the intestinal lining, leading to the inflammatory immune response. This can cause elevated temperature, painful spasms of the intestinal muscles (cramping), swelling due to water leaking from capillaries of the intestine (edema), and further tissue damage by the body's immune cells and the chemicals, called cytokines, which are released to fight the infection. The result can be impaired nutrient absorption, excessive water and mineral loss through the stools due to breakdown of the control mechanisms in the intestinal tissue that normally remove water from the stools, and in severe cases, the entry of pathogenic organisms into the bloodstream. Extensive cellular damage or death is required to cause bleeding. Bacteria can do this either by invading into intestinal mucosa or by secreting toxins that cause cell death. Bacterial infections that cause bloody diarrhea are typically classified as being either invasive or toxogenic. Invasive species cause damage directly by invading into the mucosa. The toxogenic species do not invade, but cause cellular damage by secreting toxins, resulting in bloody diarrhea."}

Conditions associated with VHL disease include angiomatosis, hemangioblastomas, pheochromocytoma, renal cell carcinoma, pancreatic cysts (pancreatic serous cystadenoma), endolymphatic sac tumor, and bilateral papillary cystadenomas of the epididymis (men) or broad ligament of the uterus (women). Angiomatosis occurs in 37. 2% of patients presenting with VHL disease and usually occurs in the retina. As a result, loss of vision is very common. However, other organs can be affected: strokes, heart attacks, and cardiovascular disease are common additional symptoms. Approximately 40% of VHL disease presents with CNS hemangioblastomas and they are present in around 60-80%. Spinal hemangioblastomas are found in 13-59% of VHL disease and are specific because 80% are found in VHL disease. Although all of these tumours are common in VHL disease, around half of cases present with only one tumour type. The disease is caused by mutations of the von Hippel\u2013Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) gene on the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p25-26). There are over 1500 germline mutations and somatic mutations found in VHL disease. Every cell in the body has 2 copies of every gene (bar those found in the sex chromosomes, X and Y). In VHL disease, one copy of the VHL gene has a mutation and produces a faulty VHL protein (pVHL). However, the second copy still produces a functional protein. Tumours form from only those cells where the second copy of the gene has been mutated. A lack of this protein allows tumors characteristic of von Hippel\u2013Lindau syndrome to develop. Approximately 20% of cases of VHL disease are found in individuals without a family history, known as de novo mutations.

Highly differentiated adenocarcinomas form SRCCs via a loss of adherens and tight junctions that typically separate MUC4, a mucin protein, and ErbB2, an oncogenic receptor. When MUC4 and ErbB2 are able to interact, they trigger an activation loop. As a result, the ErbB2/ErbB3 signaling pathway becomes constitutively activated, cell-cell interactions are lost and signet carcinomas are formed. Constitutive action of the ErbB2/ErbB3 complex also enhances cell growth. The mechanism of this malignant cancer is still unclear; however, it has been found that a colon carcinoma cell known as HCC2998 causes an increase in differentiated tumor production. The reason for this increase is due to active PI3K that are converted to a SRCC-like cells. The pattern of metastasis is different for gastric signet cell carcinoma than for intestinal-type gastric carcinoma. The SRCC tumor is often seen in the peritoneum and has also been known to spread to lymphatic permeation of the lungs and to the ovaries, creating Krukenberg tumors. Cases of gastric carcinomas metastasizing to the breast and forming signet-ring cells have also been reported. One study suggests that when signet-ring cells are found in a breast tumor, the presence of gastric cancer should also be considered. Some cases are inherited, and these cases are often caused by mutations in the CDH1 gene, which encodes the important cell-cell adhesion glycoprotein E-cadherin. A down-regulation of E-cadherin is essential for the initiation and progression a gastric signet ring cell cancer cells. Once those cells lose E-cadherin, their motility increases due to an epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Somatic mutations of the APC gene have also been implicated in the development of gastric SRCCs. The role of other risk factors in gastric cancer such as salt-preserved food, smoking, auto-immune gastritis are not well studied in SRCC. SRCCs are named due to their resemblance to signet rings, which result from the formation of large vacuoles full of mucin that displace the nucleus to the cell's periphery. Stomach cancers with both adenocarcinoma and some SRC (known as mixed-SRCC) exhibit more aggressive behavior than purely SRCC or non-SRCC histologies.

Another treatment for acute FLD is pure oxygen therapy. For chronic FLD, there is no true treatment because the patient has developed hypersensitivity meaning their FLD could last the rest of their life.

Associated complaints or diseases include arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS). Associations with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) have also been reported. Diagnosis is generally by assessment of inflammatory markers in stool followed by colonoscopy with biopsy of pathological lesions. IBD is a complex disease which arises as a result of the interaction of environmental and genetic factors leading to immunological responses and inflammation in the intestine. As a result of microbial symbiosis and immunity, alterations in enteral bacteria may contribute to inflammatory gut diseases. IBD-affected individuals have been found to have 30\u201350 percent reduced biodiversity of commensal bacteria, such as decreases in Firmicutes (namely Lachnospiraceae) and Bacteroidetes. Further evidence of the role of gut flora in the cause of inflammatory bowel disease is that IBD-affected individuals are more likely to have been prescribed antibiotics in the 2\u20135 year period before their diagnosis than unaffected individuals. The enteral bacteria can be altered by environmental factors, such as concentrated milk fats (a common ingredient of processed foods and confectionery) or oral medications such as antibiotics and oral iron preparations. Loss of integrity of the intestinal epithelium plays a key pathogenic role in IBD. Innate immune dysfunction through aberrant TLR signaling contributes to acute and chronic inflammatory processes in IBD colitis and associated cancer. Changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota are an important environmental factor in the development of IBD. Detrimental changes in the intestinal microbiota induce an inappropriate (uncontrolled) immune response that results in damage to the intestinal epithelium. Breaches in this critical barrier (the intestinal epithelium) allow further infiltration of microbiota that, in turn, elicit further immune responses. IBD is a multifactorial disease that is nonetheless driven in part by an exaggerated immune response to gut microbiota that causes defects in epithelial barrier function. High protein intake, specifically animal protein via meat and fish consumption has been significantly associated with inflammatory bowel disease as well as ulcerative colitis. There was no such association related to plant proteins in the prospective study consisting of over 65,000 patients over a 10-year period. Animal proteins have greater amounts of sulphur containing amino acids such as methionine, which the colonic microflora accrues into hydrogen sulfide, resulting in the pathogenesis of IBD and ulcerative colitis.

A few of the less common types are pleomorphic, carcinoid tumor, salivary gland carcinoma, and unclassified carcinoma. All types can occur in unusual histologic variants and as mixed cell-type combinations. Non-squamous cell carcinoma almost occupy the half of NSCLC. In the tissue classification, the centural type contains about one-ninth. Sometimes the phrase \"not otherwise specified\", or NOS is used generically, usually when a more specific diagnosis cannot be made. This is most often the case when a pathologist examines a small amount of malignant cells or tissue in a cytology or biopsy specimen. Lung cancer in never-smokers is almost universally NSCLC, with a sizeable majority being adenocarcinoma. On relatively rare occasions, malignant lung tumors are found to contain components of both SCLC and NSCLC. In these cases, the tumors should be classified as combined small cell lung carcinoma (c-SCLC), and are (usually) treated like \"pure\" SCLC. Adenocarcinoma of the lung is currently the most common type of lung cancer in \"never smokers\" (lifelong non-smokers). Adenocarcinomas account for approximately 40% of lung cancers. Historically, adenocarcinoma was more often seen peripherally in the lungs than small cell lung cancer and squamous cell lung cancer, both of which tended to be more often centrally located. However, recent studies suggest that the \"ratio of centrally-to-peripherally occurring\" lesions may be converging toward unity for both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung is more common in men than in women. It is closely correlated with a history of tobacco smoking, more so than most other types of lung cancer. According to the Nurses' Health Study, the relative risk of SCC is approximately 5. 5, both among those with a previous duration of smoking of 1 to 20 years, and those with 20 to 30 years, compared to never-smokers. The relative risk increases to approximately 16 with a previous smoking duration of 30 to 40 years, and approximately 22 with more than 40 years. Large cell lung carcinoma (LCLC) is a heterogeneous group of undifferentiated malignant neoplasms originating from transformed epithelial cells in the lung."}

However, these are common and relatively non-specific indications for cytogenetic analysis, and the extent to which the duplication of 22q11. 2 causes these features is currently unknown. The duplication is frequently inherited from a normal parent, so it is clear that intellectual development can be normal. Duplications of 22q11 vary in size and thereby in gene content. They include the typical common 3-Mb microduplication, 1. 5-Mb nested duplication, consistent with non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) using distinct low-copy repeats. These microduplications likely represent the predicted reciprocal rearrangements to the microdeletions characterized in the 22q11. 2 region. Smaller microduplications may occur within this highly dynamic with frequent rearrangements using alternative low-copy repeats as recombination substrates within and distal to the DiGeorge syndrome region. The majority of 22q11 duplications are inherited often from a parent with a normal or near-normal phenotype. This is in sharp distinction to 22q11 deletion syndrome where about 90% of cases are caused by mutations that occur de novo."}

A recent review on lumbar stenosis in the Journal of the American Medical Association's \"Rational Clinical Examination Series\" emphasized that the syndrome can be considered when lower extremity pain occurs in combination with back pain. This syndrome occurs in 12% of older community dwelling men and up to 21% of those in retirement communities. The leg symptoms in lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) are similar to those found with vascular claudication, giving rise to the term pseudoclaudication. These symptoms include pain, weakness, and tingling of the legs, which may radiate down the leg to the feet. Additional symptoms in the legs may be fatigue, heaviness, weakness, a sensation of tingling, pricking, or numbness and leg cramps, as well as bladder symptoms. Symptoms are most commonly bilateral and symmetrical, but they may be unilateral; leg pain is usually more troubling than back pain. Pseudoclaudication, now referred to as neurogenic claudication, typically worsen with standing or walking and improve with sitting. The occurrence is often related to posture and lumbar extension. Lying on the side is often more comfortable than lying flat, since it permits greater lumbar flexion. Vascular claudication can resemble spinal stenosis, and some individuals experience unilateral or bilateral symptoms radiating down the legs rather than true claudication. The first symptoms of stenosis include bouts of low back pain. After a few months or years, this may progress to claudication. The pain may be radicular, following the classic neurologic pathways. This occurs as the spinal nerves or spinal cord become increasingly trapped in a smaller space within the canal. It can be difficult to determine whether pain in the elderly is caused by lack of blood supply or stenosis; testing can usually differentiate between them but patients can have both vascular disease in the legs and spinal stenosis. Among people with lower extremity pain in combination with back pain, lumbar stenosis as the cause is two times more likely in those older than 70 years of age while those younger than 60 years it is 0. 40 as likely. The character of the pain is also useful. When the discomfort does not occur while seated, the likelihood of LSS increases considerably around 7."}

This is usually at the ligament-bone junction of the patellar ligament and the tibial tuberosity. The tibial tuberosity is a slight elevation of bone on the anterior and proximal portion of the tibia. The patellar tendon attaches the anterior quadriceps muscles to the tibia via the knee cap. Intense knee pain is usually the presenting symptom that occurs during activities such as running, jumping, squatting, and especially ascending or descending stairs and during kneeling. The pain is worse with acute knee impact. The pain can be reproduced by extending the knee against resistance, stressing the quadriceps, or striking the knee. Pain is initially mild and intermittent. In the acute phase, the pain is severe and continuous in nature. Impact of the affected area can be very painful. Bilateral symptoms are observed in 20\u201330% of people. This test can see various warning signs that predict if OSD might occur. Ultrasonography can detect if there is any swelling within the tissue as well as cartilage swelling. Ultrasonography's main goal is to identify OSD in the early stage rather than later on. It has unique features such as detection of an increase of swelling within the tibia or the cartilage surrounding the area and can also see if there is any new bone starting to build up around the tibial tuberosity. OSD may result in an avulsion fracture, with the tibial tuberosity separating from the tibia (usually remaining connected to a tendon or ligament). This injury is uncommon because there are mechanisms that prevent strong muscles from doing damage. The fracture on the tibial tuberosity can be a complete or incomplete break. Type I: A small fragment is displaced proximally and does not require surgery. Type II: The articular surface of the tibia remains intact and the fracture occurs at the junction where the secondary center of ossification and the proximal tibial epiphysis come together (may or may not require surgery)."}

People with more severe haemophilia suffer more severe and more frequent bleeds, while people with mild haemophilia usually suffer more minor symptoms except after surgery or serious trauma. In cases of moderate haemophilia symptoms are variable which manifest along a spectrum between severe and mild forms. In both haemophilia A and B, there is spontaneous bleeding but a normal bleeding time, normal prothrombin time, normal thrombin time, but prolonged partial thromboplastin time. Internal bleeding is common in people with severe haemophilia and some individuals with moderate haemophilia. The most characteristic type of internal bleed is a joint bleed where blood enters into the joint spaces. This is most common with severe haemophiliacs and can occur spontaneously (without evident trauma). If not treated promptly, joint bleeds can lead to permanent joint damage and disfigurement. Bleeding into soft tissues such as muscles and subcutaneous tissues is less severe but can lead to damage and requires treatment. Children with mild to moderate haemophilia may not have any signs or symptoms at birth especially if they do not undergo circumcision. Their first symptoms are often frequent and large bruises and haematomas from frequent bumps and falls as they learn to walk. Swelling and bruising from bleeding in the joints, soft tissue, and muscles may also occur. Children with mild haemophilia may not have noticeable symptoms for many years. Often, the first sign in very mild haemophiliacs is heavy bleeding from a dental procedure, an accident, or surgery. Females who are carriers usually have enough clotting factors from their one normal gene to prevent serious bleeding problems, though some may present as mild haemophiliacs. Severe complications are much more common in cases of severe and moderate haemophilia. Complications may arise from the disease itself or from its treatment: - Deep internal bleeding, e. g. deep-muscle bleeding, leading to swelling, numbness or pain of a limb."}

Proper rest to the eye and its muscles is recommended to relieve the associated eye strain. Various catch-phrases have been used to spread awareness about giving rest to the eyes while working on computers. A routinely recommended approach is to consciously blink the eyes every now and then (this helps replenish the tear film) and to look out the window to a distant object or to the sky\u2014doing so provides rest to the ciliary muscles. One of the catch phrases is the \"20 20 20 rule\": every 20 mins, focus the eyes on an object 20 feet (6 meters) away for 20 seconds. This basically gives a convenient distance and timeframe for a person to follow the advice from the optometrist and ophthalmologist. Otherwise, the patient is advised to close his/her eyes (which has a similar effect) for 20 seconds, at least every half-hour.

Less commonly, CLL may present with enlarged lymph nodes without a high white blood cell count or no evidence of the disease in the blood. This is referred to as small lymphocytic lymphoma. In some individuals, the disease comes to light only after the cancerous cells overwhelm the bone marrow resulting in anemia producing tiredness or weakness. CLL is caused by multiple genetic mutations and epigenetic changes. Men are about twice as likely to get CLL as women, and risk increases with age. It is relatively rare among Asians. Some relevant genetic mutations may be inherited; in around 9% of CLL cases a parent had CLL. Exposure to Agent Orange increases the risk of CLL, and exposure to certain insecticides may increase the risk. Exposure to ionizing radiation and viral infection have been explored as risk factors but there is little evidence. Blood transfusions have been ruled out as a risk factor. CLL is usually first suspected by a diagnosis of lymphocytosis, an increase in a type of white blood cell, on a complete blood count test. This frequently is an incidental finding on a routine physician visit. Most often the lymphocyte count is greater than 5000 cells per microliter (\u00b5l) of blood, but can be much higher. The presence of lymphocytosis in an elderly individual should raise strong suspicion for CLL, and a confirmatory diagnostic test, in particular flow cytometry, should be performed unless clinically unnecessary. The diagnosis of CLL is based on the demonstration of an abnormal population of B lymphocytes in the blood, bone marrow, or tissues that display an unusual but characteristic pattern of molecules on the cell surface. This atypical molecular pattern includes the coexpression of cell surface markers clusters of differentiation 5 (CD5) and 23. In addition, all the CLL cells within one individual are clonal, that is, genetically identical. In practice, this is inferred by the detection of only one of the mutually exclusive antibody light chains, kappa or lambda, on the entire population of the abnormal B cells. Normal B lymphocytes consist of a stew of different antibody-producing cells, resulting in a mixture of both kappa- and lambda-expressing cells."}

About 90% of DFSPs are low grade sarcomas. About 10% are mixed; they contain a high-grade sarcomatous component (DFSP-FS); therefore, they are considered to be intermediate-grade sarcomas. DFSPs rarely lead to a metastasis (fewer than 5% do metastasise), but DFSPs can recur locally. DFSPs most often arise in patients who are in their thirties, but sometimes have been described in children or the elderly. More than 90% of DFSP tumors have the chromosomal translocation t(17;22). The translocation fuses the collagen gene (COL1A1) with the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) gene. The fibroblast, the cell of origin of this tumor, expresses the fusion gene in the belief that it codes for collagen. However the resulting fusion protein is processed into mature platelet-derived growth factor which is a potent growth factor. Fibroblasts contain the receptor for this growth factor. Thus the cell \"thinks\" it is producing a structural protein, but it actually produces a self-stimulatory growth signal. The cell divides rapidly and a tumor forms. The tissue is often positive for CD34. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is diagnosed with a biopsy, when a portion of the tumor is removed for examination. In order to ensure that enough tissue is removed to make an accurate diagnosis, the initial biopsy of a suspected DFSP is usually done with a core needle or a surgical incision. Treatment is primarily surgical, with chemotherapy and radiation therapy sometimes used. The NCCN guideline recommends CCPDMA or Mohs surgery for the best cure rate of DFSP. Mohs surgery can be extremely effective."}

It is frequently caused by autonomic neuropathy. This may occur in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. In fact, diabetes mellitus has been named as the most common cause of gastroparesis, as high levels of blood glucose may effect chemical changes in the nerves. The vagus nerve becomes damaged by years of high blood glucose or insufficient transport of glucose into cells resulting in gastroparesis. Gastroparesis has also been associated with connective tissue diseases such as scleroderma and Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome, and neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease. It may also occur as part of a mitochondrial disease. Opioids and anticholinergic medications can cause medication-induced gastroparesis. Chronic gastroparesis can be caused by other types of damage to the vagus nerve, such as abdominal surgery. Heavy cigarette smoking is also a plausible cause since smoking causes damage to the stomach lining. Idiopathic gastroparesis (gastroparesis with no known cause) accounts for a third of all chronic cases; it is thought that many of these cases are due to an autoimmune response triggered by an acute viral infection. Gastroenteritis, mononucleosis, and other ailments have been anecdotally linked to the onset of the condition, but no systematic study has proven a link. Gastroparesis sufferers are disproportionately female. One possible explanation for this finding is that women have an inherently slower stomach emptying time than men. A hormonal link has been suggested, as gastroparesis symptoms tend to worsen the week before menstruation when progesterone levels are highest. Neither theory has been proven definitively. Gastroparesis can also be connected to hypochlorhydria and be caused by chloride, sodium and/or zinc deficiency, as these minerals are needed for the stomach to produce adequate levels of gastric acid (HCl) in order to properly empty itself of a meal. Gastroparesis can be diagnosed with tests such as x-rays, manometry, and gastric emptying scans."}

The signs of sebaceous adenitis are caused by an inflammatory disease process which affects the sebaceous glands of the skin. The cause of the inflammatory disease is unknown. Different breeds of dogs may have different underlying causes of the disease. Research is currently underway to find if there is a genetic predisposition for sebaceous adenitis; the exact mode of inheritance remains unknown. In Standard Poodles, sebaceous adenitis is most likely an autosomal recessive inherited disease, with variable expression. In general, sebaceous adenitis is underdiagnosed in dogs. Diagnosis confirmation requires multiple punch biopsies analysed by a dermopathologist who will comment on the condition of the sebaceous glands, revealing granulomatous or pyogranulomatous inflammation surrounding the sebaceous glands or even complete destruction of sebaceous glands. Other conditions with similar presentations include: bacterial folliculitis and demodicosis, dermatophytosis, endocrinopathy, pemphigus foliaceus, zinc responsive dermatosis, vitamin A-responsive dermatosis, ichthyosis, and nutritional deficiencies. As well as, superficial pyoderma, primary idiopathic seborrhea and other endocrine diseases. There is no cure for this condition. Treatment is generally lifelong and takes the form of bathing and soaking in mineral oils and washing with antibiotic shampoos to try to alleviate symptoms and slow the condition's progression. Antiseptic and antibiotic shampoos (chlorhexidine or benzoyl peroxide) are used to manage further secondary bacterial infection. For some breeds, cyclosporine or corticosteroids and immunosuppressant drugs may be effective, and it is postulated, through some studies, that large doses of vitamin A given orally may result in some improvement. It has been suggested that the more aggressively one applies the topical methods of treatment, the less aggressively one needs to employ the immunosuppressant therapy. The suggestion is that this phenomenon may be due to a cyclic feedback whereby secondary infection, when not aggressively treated with topical therapy, increases and contributes to further sebaceous gland inflammation. This forms a major and critical part in the disease treatment and the shampoo treatment can need to be applied as often as 3 to 4 times per week.

Although the symptoms subside rapidly, commonly within 1 hour, CU may significantly impair quality of life, especially in relation to sporting activities. Though overall research is limited, various studies indicate that CU is relatively common across populations with prevalence rates reportedly ranging from 5% to 20% (depending on locale, race, and age). The condition is more common in young adults, and prevalence appears to peak in adults aged 26\u201328 (up to 20%). The vast majority of cases are reported to be mild, and proportionally few individuals seek medical attention regarding the condition. This subtype of CU refers to those who are hypersensitive to their own sweat. Diagnosis is made by injecting autologous (the person's own) sweat into the skin. The hives are observed to coincide with perspiration points of sweating. Tanaka et al. found that the sweat hyper-sensitivities of CU and atopic dermatitis seem to be virtually the same, and therefore, the sweat-induced histamine release from basophils may also be mediated by a specific IgE for sweat in atopic dermatitis as well as CU. This subtype of CU refers to those who have abnormally reduced sweating. Sweat is readily visualized by a topical indicator such as iodinated starch or sodium alizarin sulphonate. Both undergo a dramatic colour change when moistened by sweat. A thermoregulatory sweat test evaluates the body\u2019s response to a thermal stimulus by inducing sweating through the use of a hot box \u2044 room, thermal blanket or exercise. Failure of the topical indicator to undergo a colour change during thermoregulatory sweat testing can indicate anhidrosis and/or hypohidrosis (see Minor test).

In people, local exanthema appears on the arms and face. The infection resolves on its own but those who are immunosuppressed can progress to systemic infection that closely resembles smallpox. When the infection has expanded to severe symptoms, it can be lethal. The signs of cowpox infection in cats can be seen as, multiple skin sores on the paws, neck, head and mouth. The cat can also develop a purulent discharge from the eyes. Necrotizing pneumonia has also been observed. Estimates that 50% of human cases of cowpox are due to transmission from cats in the United Kingdom. The avian flu virus H7N2 has been found in cats in New York City. Though transmission to people is possible, it is thought to be rare. In Europe, cats were identified as being hosts for West Nile virus. The bacterium Pasteurella multocida and its genus can pose a risk of severe diseases in high-risk groups such as the elderly, transplant recipients, cancer patients and immunocompromised individuals. Transmission of the infection to the human from the cat has been attributed to kissing the cat, providing care that exposes the person to the body fluids of the cat and sleeping with the cat.

The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) defines chemophobia as an \"irrational fear of chemicals\". According to the American Council on Science and Health, chemophobia is a fear of synthetic substances arising from \"scare stories\" and exaggerated claims about their dangers prevalent in the media. Despite containing the suffix -phobia, the majority of written work focusing on addressing chemophobia describes it as a non-clinical aversion or prejudice, and not as a phobia in the standard medical definition. Chemophobia is generally addressed by chemical education and public outreach. Michelle Francl has written: \"We are a chemophobic culture. Chemical has become a synonym for something artificial, adulterated, hazardous, or toxic. \" She characterizes chemophobia as \"more like color blindness than a true phobia\" because chemophobics are \"blind\" to most of the chemicals that they encounter: every substance in the universe is a chemical. Francl proposes that such misconceptions are not innocuous, as demonstrated in one case by local statutes opposing the fluoridation of public water despite documented cases of tooth loss and nutritional deficit. In terms of risk perception, naturally occurring chemicals feel safer than synthetic ones to most people. Consequently, people fear man-made or \"unnatural\" chemicals, while accepting natural chemicals that are known to be dangerous or poisonous. The Carcinogenic Potency Project, which is a part of the US EPA's Distributed Structure-Searchable Toxicity (DSSTox) Database Network, has been systemically testing the carcinogenicity of chemicals, both natural and synthetic, and building a publicly available database of the results since the 1980s. Their work attempts to fill in the gaps in our scientific knowledge of the carcinogenicity of all chemicals, both natural and synthetic, as the scientists conducting the Project described in the journal, Science, in 1992: Toxicological examination of synthetic chemicals, without similar examination of chemicals that occur naturally, has resulted in an imbalance in both the data on and the perception of chemical carcinogens. Three points that we have discussed indicate that comparisons should be made with natural as well as synthetic chemicals. 1) The vast proportion of chemicals that humans are exposed to occur naturally. Nevertheless, the public tends to view chemicals as only synthetic and to think of synthetic chemicals as toxic despite the fact that every natural chemical is also toxic at some dose. The daily average exposure of Americans to burnt material in the diet is ~2000 mg, and exposure to natural pesticides (the chemicals that plants produce to defend themselves) is ~1500 mg. In comparison, the total daily exposure to all synthetic pesticide residues combined is ~0. 09 mg. Thus, we estimate that 99."}

If there is severe bleeding, anemia can result, showing symptoms such as pale skin, irritability, weakness, dizziness, brittle nails, and shortness of breath. Symptoms are ineffectual straining to empty the bowels, diarrhea, rectal bleeding and possible discharge, a feeling of not having adequately emptied the bowels, involuntary spasms and cramping during bowel movements, left-sided abdominal pain, passage of mucus through the rectum, and anorectal pain. Proctitis has many possible causes. It may occur idiopathically (idiopathic proctitis). Other causes include damage by irradiation (for example in radiation therapy for cervical cancer and prostate cancer) or as a sexually transmitted infection, as in lymphogranuloma venereum and herpes proctitis. Studies suggest a celiac disease-associated \"proctitis\" can result from an intolerance to gluten. A common cause is engaging in anal sex with partner(s) infected with sexual transmitted diseases in men who have sex with men. Shared enema usage has been shown to facilitate the spread of Lymphogranuloma venereum proctitis. Doctors can diagnose proctitis by looking inside the rectum with a proctoscope or a sigmoidoscope. A biopsy is taken, in which the doctor scrapes a tiny piece of tissue from the rectum, and this tissue is then examined by microscopy. The physician may also take a stool sample to test for infections or bacteria. If the physician suspects that the patient suffers from Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, colonoscopy or barium enema X-rays are used to examine areas of the intestine. Treatment for proctitis varies depending on severity and the cause. For example, the physician may prescribe antibiotics for proctitis caused by bacterial infection. If the proctitis is caused by Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, the physician may prescribe the drug 5-aminosalicyclic acid (5ASA) or corticosteroids applied directly to the area in enema or suppository form, or taken orally in pill form. Enema and suppository applications are usually more effective, but some patients may require a combination of oral and rectal applications.

It is possible for a newborn with this disease to have neutropenia and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia as well. Hemolysis leads to elevated bilirubin levels. After delivery bilirubin is no longer cleared (via the placenta) from the neonate's blood and the symptoms of jaundice (yellowish skin and yellow discoloration of the whites of the eyes) increase within 24 hours after birth. Like other severe neonatal jaundice, there is the possibility of acute or chronic kernicterus, however the risk of kernicterus is higher because of the rapid destruction of blood cells. It is important to note that isoimmunization is a risk factor for neurotoxicity and lowers the level at which kernicterus can occur. Untreated profound anemia can cause high-output heart failure, with pallor, enlarged liver and/or spleen, generalized swelling, and respiratory distress. HDN can be the cause of hydrops fetalis, an often-severe form of prenatal heart failure that causes fetal edema. Antibodies are produced when the body is exposed to an antigen foreign to the make-up of the body. If a mother is exposed to a foreign antigen and produces IgG (as opposed to IgM which does not cross the placenta), the IgG will target the antigen, if present in the fetus, and may affect it in utero and persist after delivery. The three most common models in which a woman becomes sensitized toward (i. e. , produces IgG antibodies against) a particular antigen are hemorrhage, blood transfusion, and ABO incompatibility. Fetal-maternal hemorrhage, which is the movement of fetal blood cells across the placenta, can occur during abortion, ectopic pregnancy, childbirth, ruptures in the placenta during pregnancy (often caused by trauma), or medical procedures carried out during pregnancy that breach the uterine wall. In subsequent pregnancies, if there is a similar incompatibility in the fetus, these antibodies are then able to cross the placenta into the fetal bloodstream to attach to the red blood cells and cause their destruction (hemolysis). This is a major cause of HDN, because 75% of pregnancies result in some contact between fetal and maternal blood, and 15-50% of pregnancies have hemorrhages with the potential for immune sensitization. The amount of fetal blood needed to cause maternal sensitization depends on the individual's immune system and ranges from 0. 1 mL to 30 mL. The woman may have received a therapeutic blood transfusion. ABO blood group system and the D antigen of the Rhesus (Rh) blood group system typing are routine prior to transfusion."}

Blood tests of liver function in patients with cholangiocarcinoma often reveal a so-called \"obstructive picture,\" with elevated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transferase levels, and relatively normal transaminase levels. Such laboratory findings suggest obstruction of the bile ducts, rather than inflammation or infection of the liver parenchyma, as the primary cause of the jaundice. Although most patients present without any known risk factors evident, a number of risk factors for the development of cholangiocarcinoma have been described. In the Western world, the most common of these is primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts which is closely associated with ulcerative colitis (UC). Epidemiologic studies have suggested that the lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma for a person with PSC is on the order of 10%\u201315%, although autopsy series have found rates as high as 30% in this population. Certain parasitic liver diseases may be risk factors as well. Colonization with the liver flukes Opisthorchis viverrini (found in Thailand, Laos PDR, and Vietnam) or Clonorchis sinensis (found in China, Taiwan, eastern Russia, Korea, and Vietnam) has been associated with the development of cholangiocarcinoma. Patients with chronic liver disease, whether in the form of viral hepatitis (e. g. hepatitis B or hepatitis C), alcoholic liver disease, or cirrhosis of the liver due to other causes, are at significantly increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma. HIV infection was also identified in one study as a potential risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma, although it was unclear whether HIV itself or other correlated and confounding factors (e. g. hepatitis C infection) were responsible for the association. Infection with the bacteria Helicobacter bilis and Helicobacter hepaticus species can cause biliary cancer. Congenital liver abnormalities, such as Caroli's syndrome (a specific type of five recognized choledochal cysts), have been associated with an approximately 15% lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma. The rare inherited disorders Lynch syndrome II and biliary papillomatosis have also been found to be associated with cholangiocarcinoma. The presence of gallstones (cholelithiasis) is not clearly associated with cholangiocarcinoma. However, intrahepatic stones (called hepatolithiasis), which are rare in the West but common in parts of Asia, have been strongly associated with cholangiocarcinoma."}

Also, some premature newborns with BWS do not have macroglossia until closer to their anticipated delivery date. Given the variation among individuals with BWS and the lack of a simple diagnostic test, identifying BWS can be difficult. In an attempt to standardize the classification of BWS, DeBaun et al. have defined a child as having BWS if the child has been diagnosed by a physician as having BWS and if the child has at least two of the five common features associated with BWS (macroglossia, macrosomia, midline abdominal wall defects, ear creases/ear pits, neonatal hypoglycemia). Another definition presented by Elliot et al. includes the presence of either three major features (anterior abdominal wall defect, macroglossia, or prepostnatal overgrowth) or two major plus three minor findings (ear pits, nevus flammeus, neonatal hypoglycemia, nephromegaly, or hemihyperplasia). While most children with BWS do not develop cancer, children with BWS do have a significantly increased risk of cancer. Children with BWS are most at risk during early childhood and should receive cancer screening during this time. In general, children with BWS do very well and grow up to become adults of normal size and intelligence, usually without the syndromic features of their childhood. Most children (>80%) with BWS do not develop cancer; however, children with BWS are much more likely (~600 times more) than other children to develop certain childhood cancers, particularly Wilms' tumor (nephroblastoma), pancreatoblastoma and hepatoblastoma. Individuals with BWS appear to only be at increased risk for cancer during childhood (especially before age four) and do not have an increased risk of developing cancer in adulthood. If 100 children with BWS were followed from birth until age ten, about 10 cases of cancer would be expected in the group before age four, and about 1 case of cancer in the group would be expected between age four and ten. In addition to Wilms tumor and hepatoblastoma, children with BWS have been shown in individual case reports to develop ganglioneuroma, adrenocortical carcinoma, acute lymphoid leukemia, liver sarcoma, thyroid carcinoma, melanoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and mesoblastic nephroma. Wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma, and mesoblastic nephroma can usually be cured if diagnosed early. Early diagnosis allows physicians to treat the cancer when it is at an early stage. In addition, there is less toxic treatment. Given the importance of early diagnosis, all children with BWS should receive cancer screening. An abdominal ultrasound every 3 months until at least eight years of age is recommended and a blood test to measure alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) every 6 weeks until at least four years of age."}

They employed whole genome sequencing, along with Sanger sequencing to identify the gene that was mutated in these families. The mutations in this gene included a nonsense mutation identified in the genome of one family and an insertion mutation identified in the genome of another family. The researchers then confirmed this gene as the cause of PKD when it was not mutated in the genome of 1000 control patients. Researchers found PRRT2 mutations in 10 of 29 sporadic cases affected with PKD, thus suggests PRRT2 is the gene mutated in a subset of PKD and PKD is genetically heterogeneous. The mechanism of how PRRT2 causes PKD still requires further investigation. However, researchers suggest it may have to do with PRRT2's expression in the basal ganglia, and the expression of an associated protein, SNAP25, in the basal ganglia as well. The pathophysiology of PKD is not fully explained. A few mechanisms have been suggested thus far: 1. GABA dysregulation 2. Abnormal breakdown of dopamine in the basal ganglia 3. Dysfunction of the substantia nigra 4. A form of epilepsy Multiple methods are being used to study the potential brain abnormalities of individuals with PKD compared with \u201cnormal\u201d individuals.

It is now widely estimated that a larger percentage of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) are suffering from normal tension glaucoma: probably half of all POAG patients in Europe and the majority of POAG patients in East Asia. Among Americans of Japanese descent, for instance, the prevalence of NTG is about four times as high as the prevalence of the \"classical glaucoma\" with an IOP of 22 mm Hg and higher. The pillar of the current understanding of normal tension glaucoma is a reduced IOP tolerance of the retinal ganglion cells and the cells in the optic nerve head - an IOP of, for example, 17 or 19 mm Hg that would not affect a healthy eye leads to damage in the eye of an NTG patient. In many patients, normal tension glaucoma is common in individuals with a generalized reduced perfusion of organs and certain body tissues. A low blood pressure - whether consistently low or with sudden pressure drops - is associated with NTG as are conditions like Flammer syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea. Flammer syndrome has been attributed to increase the likelihood of ganglion cell damage in normal tension glaucoma patients with disc hemorrhages as a characteristic clinical sign. Besides race (Japanese) and low blood pressure, the female gender is also a risk factor. While tonometry, the measuring of IOP and thus a classical instrument in the diagnosis of glaucoma, is not helpful, ophthalmoscopy leads to the diagnosis by showing typical glaucomatous damage, primarily at the optic nerve head, in the absence of elevated IOP. While the excavation of the optic nerve head and the thinning of its rim appear in all kinds of glaucoma (with high tension and with normal tension,in Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and in secondary glaucoma), small hemorrhages close to the optic disc have been identified as a characteristic clinical sign of normal tension glaucoma. Visual field is very important to detect NTG. It shows a defect that typically appear deeper, steeper and closer to fixation comparing to patients with POAG. Since NTG is closely linked to vascular irregularities, a medical check-up by a general practitioner or a specialist in internal medicine is widely recommended in cases of newly diagnosed normal tension glaucoma. An examination that is considered to be of particular importance is a 24-hour monitoring of the blood pressure. NTG patients tend to suffer \"dips\", sudden and unnoticed drops in blood pressure during sleep. Without treatment, NTG leads to progressive visual field loss and in the last consequence to blindness. The mainstay of conventional glaucoma therapy, reducing IOP by pressure-lowering eye drops or by surgery, is applied in cases of NTG as well. The rationale: the lower the IOP, the less the risk of ganglion cell loss and thus in the long run of visual function. The appearance of disc hemorrhages is always a warning sign that therapeutic approaches are not successful - the small bleedings, usually described as flame-shaped, almost always indicate a progression of the disease."}

Many patients get better and do not progress beyond this phase. - A paralytic phase can follow if ischemia continues; in this phase, the abdominal pain becomes more widespread, the belly becomes more tender to the touch, and bowel motility decreases, resulting in abdominal bloating, no further bloody stools, and absent bowel sounds on exam. - Finally, a shock phase can develop as fluids start to leak through the damaged colon lining. This can result in shock and metabolic acidosis with dehydration, low blood pressure, rapid heart rate, and confusion. Patients who progress to this phase are often critically ill and require intensive care. Symptoms of ischemic colitis vary depending on the severity of the ischemia. The most common early signs of ischemic colitis include abdominal pain (often left-sided), with mild to moderate amounts of rectal bleeding. The sensitivity of findings among 73 patients were: - abdominal pain (78%) - lower digestive bleeding (62%) - diarrhea (38%) - Fever higher than (34%) Physical examination - abdominal pain (77%) - abdominal tenderness (21%) Ischemic colitis is often classified according to the underlying cause. Non-occlusive ischemia develops because of low blood pressure or constriction of the vessels feeding the colon; occlusive ischemia indicates that a blood clot or other blockage has cut off blood flow to the colon. In hemodynamically unstable patients (i. e. shock) the mesenteric perfusion may be compromised. This condition is commonly asymptomatic, and usually only apparent through a systemic inflammatory response. Mostly the result of a thromboembolism. Commonly the embolism is caused by atrial fibrillation, valvular disease, myocardial infarction, or cardiomyopathy. In addition, ischemic colitis is a well-recognized complication of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, when the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery is covered by the aortic graft. In a 1991 review concerning 2137 patients the accidental inferior mesenteric artery ligation was the most common cause (74%) of ischemic colitis. Thus, patients without adequate collateralization are at risk for ischemia of the descending and sigmoid colon. Bloody diarrhea and leukocytosis in the postoperative period are essentially diagnostic of ischemic colitis."}

A periodontal pocket contains dental plaque, bacteria and subgingival calculus. Periodontal pathogens continually find their way into the soft tissues, but normally they are held in check by the immune system. A periodontal abscess represents a change in this balance, related to decreased local or systemic resistance of the host. An inflammatory response occurs when bacteria invade and multiply within the soft tissue of the gingival crevice/periodontal pocket. A pus-filled abscess forms when the immune system responds and attempts to isolate the infection from spreading. Communication with the oral environment is maintained via the opening of the periodontal pocket. However, if the opening of a periodontal pocket becomes obstructed, as may occur if the pocket has become very deep (e. g. with furcation involvement), then plaque and calculus are trapped inside. Food packing may also obstruct a periodontal pocket. Food packing is usually caused by failure to accurately reproduce the contact points when dental restorations are placed on the interproximal surfaces of teeth."}

{"input": "The definition and classification of mental disorders are key issues for researchers as well as service providers and those who may be diagnosed. For a mental state to classify as a disorder, it generally needs to cause dysfunction.", "language": "en", "domain": "disease", "full_context": "The definition and classification of mental disorders are key issues for researchers as well as service providers and those who may be diagnosed. For a mental state to classify as a disorder, it generally needs to cause dysfunction. Most international clinical documents use the term mental \"disorder\", while \"illness\" is also common. It has been noted that using the term \"mental\" (i. e. , of the mind) is not necessarily meant to imply separateness from brain or body. According to DSM-IV, a mental disorder is a psychological syndrome or pattern which is associated with distress (e. g. via a painful symptom), disability (impairment in one or more important areas of functioning), increased risk of death, or causes a significant loss of autonomy; however it excludes normal responses such as grief from loss of a loved one, and also excludes deviant behavior for political, religious, or societal reasons not arising from a dysfunction in the individual. DSM-IV precedes the definition with caveats, stating that, as in the case with many medical terms, mental disorder \"lacks a consistent operational definition that covers all situations\", noting that different levels of abstraction can be used for medical definitions, including pathology, symptomology, deviance from a normal range, or etiology, and that the same is true for mental disorders, so that sometimes one type of definition is appropriate, and sometimes another, depending on the situation. In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) redefined mental disorders in the DSM-5 as \"a syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying mental functioning. \u201d There are currently two widely established systems that classify mental disorders: - , since 1949 part of the International Classification of Diseases produced by the WHO, - the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) produced by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) since 1952. Both of these list categories of disorder and provide standardized criteria for diagnosis. They have deliberately converged their codes in recent revisions so that the manuals are often broadly comparable, although significant differences remain. Other classification schemes may be used in non-western cultures, for example the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders, and other manuals may be used by those of alternative theoretical persuasions, for example the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual. In general, mental disorders are classified separately from neurological disorders, learning disabilities or intellectual disability. Unlike the DSM and ICD, some approaches are not based on identifying distinct categories of disorder using dichotomous symptom profiles intended to separate the abnormal from the normal. There is significant scientific debate about the relative merits of categorical versus such non-categorical (or hybrid) schemes, also known as continuum or dimensional models. A spectrum approach may incorporate elements of both. In the scientific and academic literature on the definition or classification of mental disorder, one extreme argues that it is entirely a matter of value judgements (including of what is normal) while another proposes that it is or could be entirely objective and scientific (including by reference to statistical norms)."}

These experiences may occur directly following insult or may occur several hours or even days afterwards.", "language": "en", "domain": "disease", "full_context": "Tingling, numbness, and/ or a burning sensation in the area of the body affected by the corresponding nerve. These experiences may occur directly following insult or may occur several hours or even days afterwards. Note that pain is not a common symptom of nerve entrapment. A nerve may be compressed by prolonged or repeated external force, such as sitting with one's arm over the back of a chair (radial nerve), frequently resting one's elbows on a table (ulnar nerve), or an ill-fitting cast or brace on the leg (peroneal nerve). Part of the patient's body can cause the compression and the term entrapment neuropathy is used particularly in this situation. The offending structure may be a well-defined lesion such as a tumour (for example a lipoma, neurofibroma or metastasis), a ganglion cyst or a haematoma. Alternatively, there may be expansion of the tissues around a nerve in a space where there is little room for this to occur, as is often the case in carpal tunnel syndrome. This may be due to weight gain or peripheral oedema (especially in pregnancy), or to a specific condition such as acromegaly, hypothyroidism or scleroderma and psoriasis. Some conditions cause nerves to be particularly susceptible to compression. These include diabetes, in which the blood supply to the nerves is already compromised, rendering the nerve more sensitive to minor degrees of compression. The genetic condition HNPP is a much rarer cause. External pressure reduces flow in the vessels supplying the nerve with blood (the vasa nervorum). This causes local ischaemia, which has an immediate effect on the ability of the nerve axons to transmit action potentials. As the compression becomes more severe over time, focal demyelination occurs, followed by axonal damage and finally scarring. The symptoms and signs depend on which nerve is affected, where along its length the nerve is affected, and how severely the nerve is affected. Positive sensory symptoms are usually the earliest to occur, particularly tingling and neuropathic pain, followed or accompanied by reduced sensation or complete numbness. Muscle weakness is usually noticed later, and is often associated with muscle atrophy. A compression neuropathy can usually be diagnosed confidently on the basis of the symptoms and signs alone. However, nerve conduction studies are helpful in confirming the diagnosis, quantifying the severity, and ruling out involvement of other nerves (suggesting a mononeuritis multiplex or polyneuropathy). A scan is not usually necessary, but may be helpful if a tumour or other local compressive lesion is suspected."}

A few years later, ophthalmologist Hermann Jakob Knapp called them \"angioid streaks\" because of their resemblance to blood vessels. From histopathological research in the 1930s, they were discovered to be caused by changes at the level of Bruch's membrane. Presently, it is believed that its pathology may be a combination of elastic degeneration of Bruch's membrane, iron deposition in elastic fibers from hemolysis with secondary mineralization, and impaired nutrition due to stasis and small vessel occlusion."}

The name is based on the tendency of an individual to have abnormally high levels of lymphocytes during infection. Choriomeningitis is \"cerebral meningitis in which there is marked cellular infiltration of the meninges, often with a lymphocytic infiltration of the choroid plexuses\". There are several strains of LCM virus, among which the most widely used are LCMV Armstrong and LCMV Clone 13. Armstrong is the original virus strain which was isolated from the brain by Charles Armstrong in 1934. It triggers a vigorous cytotoxic T lymphocytes(CTL) response and thus, it is cleared rapidly by the host. This is referred to as acute (Armstrong) LCMV infection. On the other hand, Clone 13 is a variant of the Armstrong viral strain, isolated from the spleen and is consequently tropic for visceral organs. It was first isolated from mice which sustained a persistent LCMV infection from birth. This variant potentiates a less vigorous CTL response in the immune system, and thus can ultimately persist in the host organism indefinitely. The latter is referred to as chronic (Clone 13) LCMV infection. LCMV is a spherical enveloped virus with a diameter between 60 and 300 nm. The helical nucleocapsid contains an RNA genome consisting of two negative single-stranded RNA segments. The negative RNA strand, complementary to the necessary mRNA strand, indicates that it must first be transcribed into a positive mRNA strand before it can be translated into the required proteins. The L strand is ambisense RNA, encoding multiple proteins in opposite directions, separated by an intergenic region. It is approximately 7. 2 kb in size and encodes a high-molecular-mass protein (L; 200 kDa) and an 11 kDa small polypeptide Z with unknown function and a ring finger motif. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is encoded by the L protein which contains conserved characteristic motifs throughout all the RNA-dependent, RNA-polymerases. The S strand is ambisense and approximately 3. 4 kb in size."}

Larger effusions may cause cardiac tamponade, a life-threatening complication; signs of impending tamponade include dyspnea, low blood pressure, and distant heart sounds. The so-called \"water-bottle heart\" is a radiographic sign of pericardial effusion, in which the cardiopericardial silhouette is enlarged and assumes the shape of a flask or water bottle. It can be associated with dullness to percussion over the left subscapular area due to compression of the left lung base. This phenomenon is known as Ewart's sign. It may be: - transudative (congestive heart failure, myxoedema, nephrotic syndrome), - exudative (tuberculosis, spread from empyema) - hemorrhagic (trauma, rupture of aneurysms, malignant effusion). - malignant (due to fluid accumulation caused by metastasis) The most common causes of pericardial effusion have changed over time and vary depending on geography and the population in question. When pericardial effusion is suspected, echocardiography usually confirms the diagnosis and allows assessment for signs of hemodynamic instability. Cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography (CT) can help to localize and quantify (as in a loculated effusion) or assess for pericardial pathology (pericardial thickening, constrictive pericarditis). Treatment depends on the underlying cause and the severity of the heart impairment. Pericardial effusion due to a viral infection usually goes away within a few weeks without the treatment. Some pericardial effusions remain small and never need treatment. If the pericardial effusion is due to a condition such as lupus, treatment with anti-inflammatory medications may help. If the effusion is compromising heart function and causing cardiac tamponade, it will need to be drained, most commonly by a needle inserted through the chest wall and into the pericardial space called pericardiocentesis. A drainage tube is often left in place for several days. In some cases, surgical drainage may be required by cutting through the pericardium creating a pericardial window."}

The disease first manifested as an epizootic outbreak among monkeys killing several of them in the year 1957. Hence the disease is also locally known as monkey disease or monkey fever. The similarity with Russian spring-summer encephalitis was noted and the possibility of migratory birds carrying the disease was raised. Studies began to look for the possible species that acted as reservoirs for the virus and the agents responsible for transmission. Subsequent studies failed to find any involvement of migratory birds although the possibility of their role in initial establishment was not ruled out. The virus was found to be quite distinctive and not closely related to the Russian virus strains. Antigenic relatedness is however close to many other strains including the Omsk hemorrhagic fever (OHF) and birds from Siberia have been found to show an antigenic response to KFD virus. Sequence based studies however note the distinctivenss of OHF. Early studies in India were conducted in collaboration with the US Army Medical Research Unit and this led to controversy and conspiracy theories. Subsequent studies based on sequencing found that the Alkhurma virus, found in Saudi Arabia is closely related. In 1989 a patient in Nanjianin, China was found with fever symptoms and in 2009 its viral gene sequence was found to exactly match with that of the KFD reference virus of 1957. This has however been questioned since the Indian virus shows variations in sequence over time and the exact match with the virus sequence of 1957 and the Chinese virus of 1989 is not expected. This study also found using immune response tests that birds and humans in the region appeared to have been exposed to the virus. Another study has suggested that the virus is recent in origin dating the nearest common ancestor of it and related viruses to around 1942, based on the estimated rate of sequence substitutions. The study also raises the possibility of bird involvement in long-distance transfer. It appears that these viruses diverged 700 years ago. The disease was first noted at Kyasanur village near Sagar in Shivamogga district of Karnataka. The virus has been detected in monkeys in parts of Bandipur National Park (Chamarajnagar) and parts of the Nilgiris. Human infection occurred in Bandipur through handling of dead monkeys that were infected."}

The syndrome has neuromuscular and endocrine manifestations. Early signs often include weakness of tongue and mouth muscles, fasciculations, and gradually increasing weakness of limb muscles with muscle wasting. Neuromuscular management is supportive, and the disease progresses very slowly, but can eventually lead to extreme disability. Further signs and symptoms include: Homozygous females, both of whose X chromosomes have a mutation leading to CAG expansion of the AR gene, have been reported to show only mild symptoms of muscle cramps and twitching. No endocrinopathy has been described. The genetics of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy have to do with the mutated androgen receptor gene located on the X chromosome. The effects of the mutation may be androgen-dependent, thus only males are fully affected. Females are rarely affected; female carriers tend to have a relatively mild expression of the disease if they show symptoms at all. The mechanism behind SBMA is caused by expansion of a CAG repeat in the first exon of the androgen receptor gene (trinucleotide repeats). The CAG repeat encodes a polyglutamine tract in the androgen receptor protein. The greater the expansion of the CAG repeat, the earlier the disease onset and more severe the disease manifestations. The repeat expansion likely causes a toxic gain of function in the receptor protein, since loss of receptor function in androgen insensitivity syndrome does not cause motor neuron degeneration. Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy may share mechanistic features with other disorders caused by polyglutamine expansion, such as Huntington's disease. No cure for SBMA is known. In regards to the diagnosis of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, the AR Xq12 gene is the focus. Many mutations are reported and identified as missense/nonsense, that can be identified with 99. 9% accuracy. Test for this gene in the majority of affected patients yields the diagnosis."}

As pituitary function is normal, ADH levels are likely to be abnormal or raised. Polyuria will continue as long as the patient is able to drink. If the patient is unable to drink and is still unable to concentrate the urine, then hypernatremia will ensue with its neurologic symptoms. Nephrogenic DI (NDI) is most common in its acquired forms, meaning that the defect was not present at birth. These acquired forms have numerous potential causes. The most obvious cause is a kidney or systemic disorder, including amyloidosis, polycystic kidney disease, electrolyte imbalance, or some other kidney defect. The major causes of acquired NDI that produce clinical symptoms (e. g. polyuria) in the adult are lithium toxicity and high blood calcium. Chronic lithium ingestion \u2013 appears to affect the tubules by entering the collecting tubule cells through sodium channels, accumulating and interfering with the normal response to ADH (ADH resistance) in a mechanism that is not yet fully understood. High blood calcium causes natriuresis (increased sodium loss in the urine) and water diuresis, in part by its effect through the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). Other causes of acquired NDI include: low blood potassium, post-obstructive polyuria, sickle cell disease/trait, amyloidosis, Sjogren syndrome, renal cystic disease, Bartter syndrome, and various medications (Amphotericin B, Orlistat, Ifosfamide, Ofloxacin, Cidofovir, Vaptanes). In addition to kidney and systemic disorders, nephrogenic DI can present itself as a side-effect to some medications. The most common and well known of these medications is lithium, although there are many other medications that cause this effect with lesser frequency. This form of DI can also be hereditary due to defects in either of the following genes: Differential diagnosis includes nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, neurogenic/central diabetes insipidus and psychogenic polydipsia.

The symptoms caused by enlarged adenoids are mostly due to where this lymphoid tissue is located. The adenoids are in the midline of the nasopharynx, and the Eustachian tubes open from either ear to the right and left of them. In children with excessive middle ear infections and chronic middle ear fluid, there is a high bacterial count in the adenoids as compared to children without problematic otitis media, even if the size of the adenoids is small. The adenoids in these cases provides a reservoir of pathogenic bacteria that cause ear infections and subsequent middle ear effusions (fluid). The nasopharynx lies right above the throat. Splashes of excessive \"drip\" from infected adenoids may land directly on the vocal cords. Although the larynx and vocal cords do not ordinarily become infected from adenoiditis, their mucosa does become irritated. The vocal cords are extremely sensitive to touch, and any fluid drops falling on them cause an irresistible urge to cough. Adenoiditis therefore is one of the causes of cough. The adenoids, like all lymphoid tissue, enlarge when infected. Although lymphoid tissue does act to fight infection, sometimes bacteria and viruses can lodge within it and survive. Chronic infection, either viral or bacterial, can keep the pad of adenoids enlarged for years, even into adulthood. Some viruses, such as the Epstein-Barr Virus, can cause dramatic enlargement of lymphoid tissue."}

Boder assisted in identifying the term musselman when in 1946 he conducted interviews with camp survivors in Europe. He asked them to describe, spell and pronounce the word for camp inmates so emaciated that they had lost the will to live. Primo Levi tried to explain the term (he also uses Musselman), in a footnote of If This Is a Man, his autobiographical account of his time in Auschwitz: This word \u2018Muselmann\u2019, I do not know why, was used by the old ones of the camp to describe the weak, the inept, those doomed to selection. The psychologist and Auschwitz survivor Viktor Frankl, in his book Man's Search for Meaning, provides the example of a prisoner who decides to use up his last cigarettes (used as currency in the concentration camps) in the evening because he is convinced he won't survive the Appell (roll call assembly) the next morning; his fellow captives derided him as a Muselmann. Frankl compares this to the dehumanized behavior and attitudes of the kapos. The testimonial of the Polish witness, Adolf Gawalewicz, Refleksje z poczekalni do gazu: ze wspomnie\u0144 muzu\u0142mana (\"Reflections in the Gas Chamber's Waiting Room: From the Memoirs of a Muselmann\"), published in 1968, incorporates the term in the title of the work. Canadian Jewish author Eli Pfefferkorn published a novel in 2011 with title The M\u00fcselmann at the Water Cooler. The term spread from Auschwitz-Birkenau to other concentration camps. Its equivalent in the Majdanek concentration camp was Gamel (derived from German gammeln - colloquial for \"rotting\") and in the Stutthof concentration camp, Krypel (derived from German Kr\u00fcppel, \"cripple\"). When prisoners reached this emaciated condition, they were selected by camp doctors and murdered by gas, bullet or various other methods. Those prisoners considered Muselm\u00e4nner and thus unable to work were also very likely to be labelled \"excess ballast\" inside the concentration camps. In spring 1941 Heinrich Himmler expressed his desire to relieve concentration camps of sick prisoners and those no longer able to work. Action T4, an \"euthanasia\" programme for mentally ill, disabled and other inmates of hospitals and nursing homes who were deemed unworthy of life, was extended to include the weakest concentration-camp prisoners. Himmler, together with Philipp Bouhler, transferred technology and techniques used in the Aktion T4 programme to the concentration camps, and later to Einsatzgruppen and death camps. The first concentration-camp victims of this program were gassed by carbon monoxide poisoning and the first known Selektion took place in April 1941 at Sachsenhausen concentration camp. By the summer of 1941 at least 400 prisoners from Sachsenhausen had been \"retired\". The scheme operated under the Concentration Camps Inspector and the Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS under the name \"Sonderbehandlung 14f13\". The combination of numbers and letters derived from the SS record-keeping system and consists of the number \"14\" for the Concentration Camps Inspector, the letter \"f\" for the German word \"deaths\" (Todesf\u00e4lle) and the number \"13\" for the cause of death, in this case \"special treatment\", a bureaucratic euphemism for gassing."}

An asymptomatic Meckel's diverticulum is called a silent Meckel's diverticulum. If symptoms do occur, they typically appear before the age of two years. The most common presenting symptom is painless rectal bleeding such as melaena-like black offensive stools, followed by intestinal obstruction, volvulus and intussusception. Occasionally, Meckel's diverticulitis may present with all the features of acute appendicitis. Also, severe pain in the epigastric region is experienced by the patient along with bloating in the epigastric and umbilical regions. At times, the symptoms are so painful that they may cause sleepless nights with acute pain felt in the foregut region, specifically in the epigastric and umbilical regions. In some cases, bleeding occurs without warning and may stop spontaneously. The symptoms can be extremely painful, often mistaken as just stomach pain resulting from not eating or constipation. Rarely, a Meckel's diverticulum containing ectopic pancreatic tissue can present with abdominal pain and increased serum amylase levels, mimicking acute pancreatitis. The omphalomesenteric duct (omphaloenteric duct, vitelline duct or yolk stalk) normally connects the embryonic midgut to the yolk sac ventrally, providing nutrients to the midgut during embryonic development. The vitelline duct narrows progressively and disappears between the 5th and 8th weeks gestation. In Meckel's diverticulum, the proximal part of vitelline duct fails to regress and involute, which remains as a remnant of variable length and location. The solitary diverticulum lies on the antimesenteric border of the ileum (opposite to the mesenteric attachment) and extends into the umbilical cord of the embryo. The left and right vitelline arteries originate from the primitive dorsal aorta, and travel with the vitelline duct. The right becomes the superior mesenteric artery that supplies a terminal branch to the diverticulum, while the left involutes.

It shows as a rubber-like hardening of fat reserves which then become unavailable for normal metabolism, resulting in extreme pain, loss of mobility and death. It is thought to be brought about by any or a combination of a number of factors which include: - Vitamin E deficiency - Microcystin poisoning - Heavy metals and other pollutants such as DDT, PCBs, PCDDs and brominated flame retardants - Ingestion of affected animals - Pathogens as yet unidentified \\ In 2008 about 170 crocodile deaths in the Olifants Gorge on the Olifants, and in the Letaba Rivers in the eastern part of the Kruger National Park in South Africa, alerted rangers and researchers to a problem that may eventually reach epidemic proportions. Dead and dying bottom-feeding catfish Clarias gariepinus that had ingested toxic pollutants such as heavy metals, had become an easy source of food for the crocodiles, with a resulting transfer of the toxins. With the onset of winter and lower temperatures, metabolism switches to fat reserves, at which time mortality peaks. These particular toxins are from the upper reaches of the river, originating from the industrial and mining complex in the Witbank and Middelburg area. Earlier, in 2007, at the Loskop Dam, higher in the Olifants River, crocodile deaths were linked to a mass die-off of fish after sewage pollution caused cyanobacterial blooms. The affected crocodiles had consumed masses of dead and dying fish. Cyanobacterial blooms (Anabaena spp. ) are common in the stagnant water of dams, but do not occur in the flowing water of rivers. High autumnal mortality among migratory herons and caused by cyanobacterial blooms, is seen regularly in brackish impoundments at Chesapeake Bay in the United States. The Massingir Dam in Mozambique, and just downstream of the Olifants Gorge, was constructed in the 1970s, but the country's civil war delayed installation of the sluice gates.

Hermansky\u2013Pudlak syndrome also impairs vision. - Bleeding disorders: Individuals with the syndrome have platelet dysfunction. Since platelets are necessary for blood clotting, individuals will bruise and bleed easily. - Cellular storage disorders: The syndrome causes a wax-like substance (ceroid) to accumulate in the body tissues and cause damage, especially in the lungs and kidneys. It is also associated with granulomatous colitis, , an inflammation of the colon, and with pulmonary fibrosis, a potentially fatal lung disease. HPS can be caused by mutations in several genes: HPS1, HPS3, HPS4, HPS5, HPS6 and HPS7. HPS type 2, which includes immunodeficiency in its phenotype, is caused by mutation in the AP3B1 gene. HPS type 7 may result from a mutation in the gene coding for dysbindin protein. Hermansky\u2013Pudlak syndrome is thought to be inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait. The defective gene, called HSP , responsible for this disorder is located on the long arm of chromosome 10 (10q2). Some research suggests that an abnormality of lysosomal function may be responsible for the development of the disease. HPS1, AP3B1, HPS3, HPS4, HPS5, HPS6, DTNBP1 and BLOC1S3 are associated with Hermansky\u2013Pudlak syndrome. In autosomal recessive disorders, the condition does not appear unless a person inherits two copies of the defective gene responsible for the disorder, one copy coming from each parent. If an individual receives one normal gene and one gene for the disorder, the person will be a carrier for the disease, but usually will not show symptoms. The risk of transmitting the disease to the children of a couple, both of whom are carriers for a recessive disorder, is 25 percent. Fifty percent of their children risk being carriers of the disease, but generally will not show symptoms of the disorder. Twenty-five percent of their children may receive both normal genes, one from each parent, and will be genetically normal (for that particular trait). The risk is the same for each pregnancy."}

In infants, feeding difficulties and poor weight gain are also frequent symptoms. In some cases of SMA syndrome, severe malnutrition accompanying spontaneous wasting may occur. This, in turn, increases the duodenal compression, which worsens the underlying cause, creating a cycle of worsening symptoms. \"Food fear\" is a common development among patients with the chronic form of SMA syndrome. For many, symptoms are partially relieved when in the left lateral decubitus or knee-to-chest position, or in the prone (face down) position. A Hayes maneuver (pressure applied below the umbilicus in cephalad and dorsal direction) elevates the root of the SMA, also slightly easing the constriction. Symptoms can be aggravated when leaning to the right or taking a supine (face up) position. Retroperitoneal fat and lymphatic tissue normally serve as a cushion for the duodenum, protecting it from compression by the SMA. SMA syndrome is thus triggered by any condition involving an insubstantial cushion and narrow mesenteric angle. SMA syndrome can present in two forms: chronic/congenital or acute/induced. Patients with the chronic, congenital form of SMA syndrome predominantly have a lengthy or even lifelong history of abdominal complaints with intermittent exacerbations depending on the degree of duodenal compression. Risk factors include anatomic characteristics such as: aesthenic (very thin or \"lanky\") body build, an unusually high insertion of the duodenum at the ligament of Treitz, a particularly low origin of the SMA, or intestinal malrotation around an axis formed by the SMA. Predisposition is easily aggravated by any of the following: poor motility of the digestive tract, retroperitional tumors, loss of appetite, malabsorption, cachexia, exaggerated lumbar lordosis, visceroptosis, abdominal wall laxity, peritoneal adhesions, abdominal trauma, rapid linear adolescent growth spurt, weight loss, starvation, catabolic states (as with cancer and burns), and history of neurological injury. The acute form of SMA syndrome develops rapidly after traumatic incidents that forcibly hyper-extend the SMA across the duodenum, inducing the obstruction, or sudden weight loss for any reason. Causes include prolonged supine bed rest, scoliosis surgery, left nephrectomy, ileo-anal pouch surgery. It is important to note, however, that while SMA syndrome can mimic an eating disorder, distinguishing the two conditions is extremely important, as misdiagnosis in this situation can be dangerous. Diagnosis is very difficult, and usually one of exclusion. SMA syndrome is thus considered only after patients have undergone an extensive evaluation of their gastrointestinal tract including upper endoscopy, and evaluation for various malabsorptive, ulcerative and inflammatory instestinal conditions with a higher diagnostic frequency. Diagnosis may follow x-ray examination revealing duodenal dilation followed by abrupt constriction proximal to the overlying SMA, as well as a delay in transit of four to six hours through the gastroduodenal region."}

Some researchers believe that the SMAD4 gene mutations that cause Myhre syndrome impair the ability of the SMAD4 protein to attach (bind) properly with the other proteins involved in the signaling pathway. Other studies have suggested that these mutations result in an abnormally stable SMAD4 protein that remains active in the cell longer. Changes in SMAD4 binding or availability may result in abnormal signaling in many cell types, which affects development of several body systems and leads to the signs and symptoms of Myhre syndrome. The patients of this disease exhibit hypertrophic phenotype in their muscle tissues. Myostatin target genes are found to be downregulated while bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) target genes display both upregulated and downregulated genotypes.

He discovered Jacobsen Syndrome in a family where multiple people had the disorder. He discovered that the affected children had unbalanced translocation between chromosome 11 and 21 which they had inherited from one of their parents who had balanced translocation. Since then only 200 cases have been reported of Jacobsen Syndrome in medical literature. The estimated prevalence of Jacobsen syndrome is believed to be approximately 1 out of every 100,000 births. For reasons unknown females are twice as likely to have Jacobsen Syndrome than males. No preference for any race or ethnicity has been reported so far. Jacobsen Syndrome is caused due to deletion of genetic material from the long arm of chromosome 11. The size of deletion may vary across patients but the deletion always occurs at the end terminal of the q arm of chromosome 11. There are three ways in which the deletion could occur: de novo deletion- this is a random event that occurred during the formation of the sperm or the egg or during the cell division in the embryonic stage, where genes from chromosome 11 get deleted. Imbalanced translocation- in this case a parent with balanced translocation or other types of chromosomal rearrangement can pass on these genes to their children which further results in an imbalanced translocation. In this case the affected children have deletions on chromosome 11 as well as some extra genetic material from another chromosome. Ring chromosome 11- in this case genetic material from both long and short arm of the chromosome get deleted and the remaining part joins together and forms a ring like structure. Here the affected person would have symptoms associated with both 11q and 11p deletion. If de novo deletion occurs then both the parents have normal chromosomes and chances that another child will have the deletion gets declined. Very few cases have been found in which the deletion has been present in mosaic form (where some of the cells have deletion on chromosome 11 and some do not and the symptoms are less severe) of one of the parent, which increases the risk of having another child with Jacobsen Syndrome. When the child's chromosomal abnormality occurs due to one of the parents balanced translocation then the chances of another child having the abnormality is high. Almost all children with Jacobsen syndrome have Intellectual disabilities, which ranges from mild to moderate depending upon the number of the deletion of genes from the chromosome. Children with intellectual disability take more time than normal to learn new things and acquire new skills. They have problems with assembling new information or adapting to novel situations and associating two events or things together."}

Mutations in the COL11A2 gene lead to a loss of function of this type of collagen, resulting in the signs and symptoms of OSMED. OSMED is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means the defective gene is located on an autosome, and two copies of the defective gene - one from each parent - must be inherited for a person to be affected by the disorder. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are usually not affected but are carriers of one copy of the altered gene.

The symptoms usually appear after a menstrual period. The most common are: - Abnormal smell and colour of vaginal discharge - Pain during ovulation - Pain during sexual intercourse - Pain coming and going during periods - Abdominal pain - Lower back pain - Fever - Nausea - Vomiting - Bloating The infection usually has its origin in the vagina and ascends to the Fallopian tube from there. Because the infection can spread via the lymph vessels, infection in one Fallopian tube usually leads to infection of the other. It's been theorized that retrograde menstrual flow and the cervix opening during menstruation allows the infection to reach the Fallopian tubes. Other risk factors include surgical procedures that break the cervical barrier, such as: - endometrial biopsy - curettage - hysteroscopy Another risk is factors that alter the microenvironment in the vagina and cervix, allowing infecting organisms to proliferate and eventually ascend to the Fallopian tube: - antibiotic treatment - ovulation - menstruation - sexually transmitted disease (STD) Finally, sexual intercourse may facilitate the spread of disease from the vagina to the Fallopian tube. Coital risk factors are: - Uterine contractions - Sperm, carrying organisms upward The bacteria most associated with salpingitis are: - N. gonorrhoeae - Chlamydia trachomatis - Mycoplasma - Staphylococcus - Streptococcus However, salpingitis is usually polymicrobial, involving many kinds of organisms. Other examples of organisms involved are: - Ureaplasma urealyticum - Anaerobic and aerobic bacteria Over one million cases of acute salpingitis are reported every year in the US, but the number of incidents is probably larger, due to incomplete and untimely reporting methods and that many cases are reported first when the illness has gone so far that it has developed chronic complications. For women age 16\u201325, salpingitis is the most common serious infection. It affects approximately 11% of females of reproductive age. Salpingitis has a higher incidence among members of lower socioeconomic classes. However, this is thought of being an effect of earlier sex debut, multiple partners, and decreased ability to receive proper health care rather than any independent risk factor for salpingitis. As an effect of an increased risk due to multiple partners, the prevalence of salpingitis is highest for people age 15\u201324 years. Decreased awareness of symptoms and less will to use contraceptives are also common in this group, raising the occurrence of salpingitis. For the affected, 20% need hospitalization. Regarding patients age 15\u201344 years, 0. 29 per 100,000 dies from salpingitis. However, salpingitis can also lead to infertility because the eggs released in ovulation can't get contact with the sperm. Approximately 75,000-225,000 cases of infertility in the US are caused by salpingitis."}

These may include: sensory, visual, psychic, autonomic, olfactory or motor phenomena. In a complex partial seizure a person may appear confused or dazed and can not respond to questions or direction. Focal seizure may become generalized. Jerking activity may start in a specific muscle group and spread to surrounding muscle groups\u2014known as a Jacksonian march. Unusual activities that are not consciously created may occur. These are known as automatisms and include simple activities like smacking of the lips or more complex activities such as attempts to pick something up. There are six main types of generalized seizures: tonic-clonic, tonic, clonic, myoclonic, absence, and atonic seizures. They all involve a loss of consciousness and typically happen without warning. - Tonic-clonic seizures present with a contraction of the limbs followed by their extension, along with arching of the back for 10\u201330 seconds. A cry may be heard due to contraction of the chest muscles. The limbs then begin to shake in unison.

Elephantiasis results when the parasites lodge in the lymphatic system. Elephantiasis affects mainly the lower extremities, while the ears, mucous membranes, and amputation stumps are affected less frequently. However, different species of filarial worms tend to affect different parts of the body; Wuchereria bancrofti can affect the legs, arms, vulva, breasts, and scrotum (causing hydrocele formation), while Brugia timori rarely affects the genitals. Those who develop the chronic stages of elephantiasis are usually free from microfilariae (amicrofilaraemic), and often have adverse immunological reactions to the microfilariae, as well as the adult worms. The subcutaneous worms present with rashes, urticarial papules, and arthritis, as well as hyper- and hypopigmentation macules. Onchocerca volvulus manifests itself in the eyes, causing \"river blindness\" (onchocerciasis), one of the leading causes of blindness in the world. Serous cavity filariasis presents with symptoms similar to subcutaneous filariasis, in addition to abdominal pain, because these worms are also deep-tissue dwellers. Human filarial nematode worms have complicated life cycles, which primarily consists of five stages. After the male and female worms mate, the female gives birth to live microfilariae by the thousands. The microfilariae are taken up by the vector insect (intermediate host) during a blood meal. In the intermediate host, the microfilariae molt and develop into third-stage (infective) larvae. Upon taking another blood meal, the vector insect injects the infectious larvae into the dermis layer of the skin. After about one year, the larvae molt through two more stages, maturing into the adult worms. Filariasis is usually diagnosed by identifying microfilariae on Giemsa stained, thin and thick blood film smears, using the \"gold standard\" known as the finger prick test. The finger prick test draws blood from the capillaries of the finger tip; larger veins can be used for blood extraction, but strict windows of the time of day must be observed. Blood must be drawn at appropriate times, which reflect the feeding activities of the vector insects. Examples are W. bancrofti, whose vector is a mosquito; night is the preferred time for blood collection. Loa loa's vector is the deer fly; daytime collection is preferred."}

This is followed by the characteristic rash or oral sores, malaise, and a low-grade fever that signal the presence of the disease. Oral manifestations of the disease (enanthem) not uncommonly may precede the external rash (exanthem). In children the illness is not usually preceded by prodromal symptoms, and the first sign is the rash or the spots in the oral cavity. The rash begins as small red dots on the face, scalp, torso, upper arms and legs; progressing over 10\u201312 hours to small bumps, blisters and pustules; followed by umbilication and the formation of scabs. At the blister stage, intense itching is usually present. Blisters may also occur on the palms, soles, and genital area. Commonly, visible evidence of the disease develops in the oral cavity and tonsil areas in the form of small ulcers which can be painful or itchy or both; this enanthem (internal rash) can precede the exanthem (external rash) by 1 to 3 days or can be concurrent. These symptoms of chickenpox appear 10 to 21 days after exposure to a contagious person. Adults may have a more widespread rash and longer fever, and they are more likely to experience complications, such as varicella pneumonia. Because watery nasal discharge containing live virus usually precedes both exanthem (external rash) and enanthem (oral ulcers) by 1 to 2 days, the infected person actually becomes contagious one to two days before recognition of the disease. Contagiousness persists until all vesicular lesions have become dry crusts (scabs), which usually entails four or five days, by which time nasal shedding of live virus ceases. The condition usually resolves by itself within a couple of weeks. The rash may, however, last for up to one month. Chickenpox is contagious starting from one to two days before the appearance of the rash and lasts until the lesions have crusted. Chickenpox is rarely fatal, although it is generally more severe in adult men than in women or children. Non-immune pregnant women and those with a suppressed immune system are at highest risk of serious complications. Arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) associated with chickenpox in the previous year accounts for nearly one third of childhood AIS. The most common late complication of chickenpox is shingles (herpes zoster), caused by reactivation of the varicella zoster virus decades after the initial, often childhood, chickenpox infection. During pregnancy the dangers to the fetus associated with a primary VZV infection are greater in the first six months."}

Because of the lyonization, inactivation, and formation of Barr bodies in all female cells, only one X chromosome is active at any time. Thus, triple X syndrome most often has only mild effects or has no effects. The symptoms vary from person to person, with some women being more affected than others. Symptoms may include tall stature, vertical skin folds that may cover the inner corners of the eyes (epicanthal folds), poor muscle tone, and a curve in the 5th finger towards the 4th. There may also be a small head (microcephaly). There are seldom any observable physical anomalies in triple X females, other than being taller than average. Poor coordination may be present. Those affected appear to have higher rates of scoliosis. Females with triple X syndrome often have delayed language development. On average those affected have IQs that are 20 points lower. Poor self-esteem, anxiety, and depression are also common. Triple X syndrome is not inherited, but usually, occurs as an event during the formation of reproductive cells (ovum and sperm). An error in cell division called nondisjunction can result in reproductive cells with additional chromosomes. For example, an oocyte or sperm cell may gain an extra copy of the X chromosome as a result of the non-disjunction. If one of these cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, the child will have an extra X chromosome in each of her cells. In some cases, trisomy X occurs during cell division in early embryonic development. Some females with triple X syndrome have an extra X chromosome in only some of their cells. These cases are called 46,XX/47,XXX mosaics."}

As there are different possible causes and contributing factors from one person to the next, the appearance of the lesion is somewhat variable. The lesions are more commonly symmetrically present on both sides of the mouth, but sometimes only one side may be affected. In some cases, the lesion may be confined to the mucosa of the lips, and in other cases the lesion may extend past the vermilion border (the edge where the lining on the lips becomes the skin on the face) onto the facial skin. Initially, the corners of the mouth develop a gray-white thickening and adjacent erythema (redness). Later, the usual appearance is a roughly triangular area of erythema, edema (swelling) and breakdown of skin at either corner of the mouth. The mucosa of the lip may become fissured (cracked), crusted, ulcerated or atrophied. There is not usually any bleeding. Where the skin is involved, there may be radiating rhagades (linear fissures) from the corner of the mouth. Infrequently, the dermatitis (which may resemble eczema) can extend from the corner of the mouth to the skin of the cheek or chin. If Staphylococcus aureus is involved, the lesion may show golden yellow crusts. In chronic angular cheilitis, there may be suppuration (pus formation), exfoliation (scaling) and formation of granulation tissue. Sometimes contributing factors can be readily seen, such as loss of lower face height from poorly made or worn dentures, which results in mandibular overclosure (\"collapse of jaws\"). If there is a nutritional deficiency underlying the condition, various other signs and symptoms such as glossitis (swollen tongue) may be present. In people with angular cheilitis who wear dentures, often there may be erythematous mucosa underneath the denture (normally the upper denture), an appearance consistent with denture-related stomatitis. Typically the lesions give symptoms of soreness, pain, pruritus (itching) or burning or a raw feeling. Angular cheilitis is thought to be multifactorial disorder of infectious origin, with many local and systemic predisposing factors. The sores in angular cheilitis are often infected with fungi (yeasts), bacteria, or a combination thereof; this may represent a secondary, opportunistic infection by these pathogens."}

Young children with DSPD resist going to bed before they are sleepy, but the bedtime struggles disappear if they are allowed to stay up until the time they usually fall asleep. - DSPD patients usually sleep well and regularly when they can follow their own sleep schedule, e. g. , on weekends and during vacations. - DSPD is a chronic condition. Symptoms must have been present for at least three months before a diagnosis of DSPD can be made. Often people with DSPD manage only a few hours sleep per night during the working week, then compensate by sleeping until the afternoon on weekends. Sleeping late on weekends, and/or taking long naps during the day, may give people with DSPD relief from daytime sleepiness but may also perpetuate the late sleep phase. People with DSPD can be called \"night owls\". They feel most alert and say they function best and are most creative in the evening and at night. People with DSPD cannot simply force themselves to sleep early. They may toss and turn for hours in bed, and sometimes not sleep at all, before reporting to work or school.

Neurological symptoms, such as developmental decline, hypotonia, and mental retardation have also been reported. The disorder is caused by a mutation of the purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) gene, located at chromosome 14q13. 1. PNP is a key enzyme in the purine salvage pathway, and is required for purine degradation. Specifically, it catalyzes the conversion of inosine to hypoxanthine and guanosine to guanine (both guanine and hypoxanthine will be made into xanthine which will then become uric acid). A deficiency of it leads to buildup of elevated deoxy-GTP (dGTP) levels resulting in T-cell toxicity and deficiency. In contrast to adenosine deaminase deficiency (another deficiency of purine metabolism), there is minimal disruption to B cells. PNP deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome (chromosome 14 is an autosome), and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder. PNP-deficiency is extremely rare. Only 33 patients with the disorder in the United States have been documented. In the United Kingdom only one child has been diagnosed with this disorder."}

Indeed, studies indicate that, among family members with the identical congenital hypofibrinogenemia mutation, some never exhibit symptoms and those that are symptomatic develop symptoms only as adults. Individuals with this disorder are usually less symptomatic than patients with other fibrinogen disorders because their fibrinogen levels are generally sufficient to prevent spontaneous bleeding. Those with particularly low blood fibrinogen levels (<0. 5 gram/liter) may develop serious bleeding spontaneously and many with the disorder do so following trauma or surgery. Depending on their fibrinogen levels, women with the disorder may also bleed excessively during delivery and the postpartum period; in rare cases, they may have an increased risk of suffering miscarriages. Individuals with the disorder also suffer thrombotic events which may include blockage of large arteries in relatively young patients who have high levels of cardiovascular risk factors. The thrombi which form in these individuals are unstable, tend to embolize, and may therefore lead to thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism. Both bleeding and thrombotic events can occur at separate times or even concurrently in the same individual with the disorder. All individuals with mutations causing fibrinogen storage disease have low blood fibrinogen levels but usually lack severe bleeding episodes, thrombotic episodes or liver disease. Individuals that do have fibrinogen storage disease often come to attention either because they have close relatives with the disease, are found to be hypofibrinogenmic during routing testing, or exhibit clinical (e. g. jaundice) or laboratory (e. g. elevated blood levels of liver enzymes) evidence of liver disease. Unlike other forms of congenital hypofibrinogenemia, a relatively high percentage of individuals with fibrinogen storage disease have been diagnosed in children of very young age. Fibrinogen is made and secreted into the blood by liver hepatocytes.

In general, atypical depression tends to cause greater functional impairment than other forms of depression. Atypical depression is a chronic syndrome that tends to begin earlier in life than other forms of depression\u2014usually beginning in the teenage years. Similarly, patients with atypical depression are more likely to suffer from personality disorders and anxiety disorders such as borderline personality disorder, avoidant personality disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and bipolar disorder. Recent research suggests that young people are more likely to suffer from hypersomnia while older people are more likely to suffer from polyphagia. Medication response differs between chronic atypical depression and acute melancholic depression. Some studies suggest that the older class of antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), may be more effective at treating atypical depression. While the more modern SSRIs and SNRIs are usually quite effective in this illness, the tricyclic antidepressants typically are not. The wakefulness-promoting agent modafinil has shown considerable effect in combating atypical depression, maintaining this effect even after discontinuation of treatment. Antidepressant response can often be enhanced with supplemental medications, such as buspirone, bupropion, or aripiprazole. Psychotherapy, whether alone or in combination with medication, is also an effective treatment."}

It also differs from PID in that it can create symptoms of acute-onset pelvic pain. Typically this disease is found in sexually active women but sexually inexperienced, virginal girls have rarely been found with this infection. The development of TOA is thought to begin with the pathogens spreading from the cervix to the endometrium, through the salpinx, into the peritoneal cavity and forming the tubo-ovarian abscess with (in some cases) pelvic peritonitis. TOA can develop from the lymphatic system with infection of the parametrium from an intrauterine device (IUD). Bacteria recovered from TOAs are Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus, Peptococcus, and aerobic streptococci. Long term IUD use is associated with TOA. Actinomyces is also recovered from TOA. Laparoscopy and other imaging tools can visualize the abscess. Physicians are able to make the diagnosis if the abscess ruptures when the woman begins to have lower abdominal pain that then begins to spread. The symptoms then become the same as the symptoms for peritonitis. Sepsis, occurs if left untreated. Ultrasonography is a sensitive enough imaging tool that it can accurately differentiate between pregnancy, hemorrhagic ovarian cysts, endometriosis, ovarian torsion, and tubo-ovarian abscess. Its availability, the relative advancement in the training of its use, its low cost, and because it does not expose the woman (or fetus) to ionizing radiation, ultrasonography an ideal imaging procedure for women of reproductive age. Risk factors have been identified which indicate what women will be more likely to develop TOA. These are: increased age, IUD insertion, chlamydia infection, and increased levels of certain proteins (CRP and CA-125) and will alert clinicians to follow up on unresolved symptoms of PID. Treatment for TOA differs from PID in that some clinicians recommend patients with tubo-ovarian abscesses have at least 24 hours of inpatient parenteral treatment with antibiotics, and that they may require surgery. If surgery becomes necessary, pre-operative administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics is started and removal of the abscess, the affected ovary and fallopian tube is done. After discharge from the hospital, oral antibiotics are continued for the length of time prescribed by the physician. Treatment is different if the TOA is discovered before it ruptures and can be treated with IV antibiotics."}

It is often used as part of the phrase \"solitary plasmacytoma\". or as part of the phrase \"extramedullary plasmacytoma\". In this context, \"extramedullary\" means outside of the bone marrow. For SPB the most common presenting symptom is that of pain in the affected bone. Back pain and other consequences of the bone lesion may occur such as spinal cord compression or pathological fracture. Around 85% of extramedullary plasmacytoma presents within the upper respiratory tract mucosa, causing possible symptoms such as epistaxis, rhinorrhoea and nasal obstruction. In some tissues it may be found as a palpable mass. The diagnosis of plasmacytoma uses a diverse range of interdisciplinary techniques including serum protein electrophoresis, bone marrow biopsy, urine analysis for Bence Jones protein and complete blood count, plain film radiography, MRI and PET-CT. Serum protein electrophoresis separates the proteins in the liquid part of the blood (serum), allowing the analysis of antibodies. Normal blood serum contains a range of antibodies and are said to be polyclonal, whereas serum from a person with plasmacytoma may show a monoclonal spike. This is due to an outgrowth of a single type of plasma cell that forms the plasmacytoma and produces a single type of antibody. The plasma cells are said to be monoclonal and the excessively produced antibody is known as monoclonal protein or paraprotein. Paraproteins are present in 60% of SPB and less than 25% of extramedullary plasmacytoma. Bone marrow biopsies are performed to ensure the disease is localised; and in SPB or extramedullary plasmacytoma there will not be an increase of monoclonal plasma cells. Tissue biopsies of SPB and extramedullary plasmacytoma are used to assess the phenotype of the plasma cells. Histological analyses can be performed on these biopsies to see what cluster of differentiation (CD) markers are present and to assess monoclonality of the cells. CD markers can aid in the distinction of extramedullary plasmacytoma from lymphomas. Skeletal surveys are used to ensure there are no other primary tumors within the axial skeleton."}

It may also result in a musty smell and lighter skin. Babies born to mothers who have poorly treated PKU may have heart problems, a small head, and low birth weight. Because the mother's body is able to break down phenylalanine during pregnancy, infants with PKU are normal at birth. The disease is not detectable by physical examination at that time, because no damage has yet been done. However, a blood test can reveal elevated phenylalanine levels after one or two days of normal infant feeding. This is the purpose of newborn screening, to detect the disease with a blood test before any damage is done, so that treatment can prevent the damage from happening. If a child is not diagnosed during the routine newborn screening test (typically performed 2\u20137 days after birth, using samples drawn by neonatal heel prick), and a phenylalanine restricted diet is not introduced, then phenylalanine levels in the blood will increase over time. Toxic levels of phenylalanine (and insufficient levels of tyrosine) can interfere with infant development in ways which have permanent effects. The disease may present clinically with seizures, hypopigmentation (excessively fair hair and skin), and a \"musty odor\" to the baby's sweat and urine (due to phenylacetate, a carboxylic acid produced by the oxidation of phenylketone). In most cases, a repeat test should be done at approximately two weeks of age to verify the initial test and uncover any phenylketonuria that was initially missed. Untreated children often fail to attain early developmental milestones, develop microcephaly, and demonstrate progressive impairment of cerebral function. Hyperactivity, EEG abnormalities, and seizures, and severe learning disabilities are major clinical problems later in life. A characteristic \"musty or mousy\" odor on the skin, as well as a predisposition for eczema, persist throughout life in the absence of treatment. The damage done to the brain if PKU is untreated during the first months of life is not reversible. It is critical to control the diet of infants with PKU very carefully so that the brain has an opportunity to develop normally. Affected children who are detected at birth and treated are much less likely to develop neurological problems or have seizures and intellectual disability (though such clinical disorders are still possible. ) In general, however, outcomes for people treated for PKU are good. Treated people may have no detectable physical, neurological, or developmental problems at all. Many adults with PKU who were diagnosed through newborn screening and have been treated since birth have high educational achievement, successful careers, and fulfilling family lives."}

Other, mostly historical, names include Don Juanism, the Messalina complex, and nymphomania. There is little consensus among experts as to the causes of hypersexuality. Some research suggests that some cases can be linked to biochemical or physiological changes that accompany dementia. Psychological needs also complicate the biological explanation, which identifies the temporal/frontal lobe of the brain as the area for regulating libido. Persons suffering from injuries to this part of the brain are at increased risk for aggressive behavior and other behavioral problems including personality changes and socially inappropriate sexual behavior such as hypersexuality. The same symptom can occur after unilateral temporal lobotomy. There are other biological factors that are associated with hypersexuality such as premenstrual changes, and the exposure to virilising hormones in childhood or in utero. In research involving use of anti-androgens to reduce undesirable sexual behaviour such as hypersexuality, testosterone has been found to be necessary, but not sufficient, for sexual drive. Other proposed factors include a lack of physical closeness, and forgetfulness of the recent past. Pathogenic overactivity of the dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway in the brain\u2014forming either psychiatrically, during mania, or pharmacologically, as a side effect of dopamine agonists, specifically D-preferring agonists\u2014is associated with various addictions and has been shown to result among some in overindulgent, sometimes hypersexual, behavior. Hypersexuality is known to present itself as a symptom in connection to a number of mental and neurological disorders. Some people with borderline personality disorder (sometimes referred to as BPD) can be markedly impulsive, seductive, and extremely sexual. Sexual promiscuity, sexual obsessions, and hypersexuality are very common symptoms for both men and women with BPD. On occasion for some there can be extreme forms of paraphilic drives and desires. \"Borderline\" patients, due in the opinion of some to the use of splitting, experience love and sexuality in unstable ways. People with bipolar disorder may often display tremendous swings in sex drive depending on their mood."}

For example, the cause of syphilitic aortitis is infectious (aortitis simply refers to inflammation of the aorta, which is an artery. ) However, the causes of many forms of vasculitis are poorly understood. There is usually an immune component, but the trigger is often not identified. In these cases, the antibody found is sometimes used in classification, as in ANCA-associated vasculitides. - Location of the affected vessels. For example, ICD-10 classifies \"vasculitis limited to skin\" with skin conditions (under \"L\"), and \"necrotizing vasculopathies\" (corresponding to systemic vasculitis) with musculoskeletal system and connective tissue conditions (under \"M\"). Arteritis/phlebitis on their own are classified with circulatory conditions (under \"I\"). - Type or size of the blood vessels that they predominantly affect. Apart from the arteritis/phlebitis distinction mentioned above, vasculitis is often classified by the caliber of the vessel affected. However, there can be some variation in the size of the vessels affected. According to the size of the vessel affected, vasculitis can be classified into: - Large vessel: Polymyalgia rheumatica, Takayasu's arteritis, Temporal arteritis - Medium vessel: Buerger's disease, Kawasaki disease, Polyarteritis nodosa - Small vessel: Beh\u00e7et's syndrome, Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Cutaneous vasculitis, Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura, Microscopic polyannulomatosis ConditionofSome disorders have vasculitis as their main feature. The major types are given in the table below: Takayasu's arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa and giant cell arteritis mainly involve arteries and are thus sometimes classed specifically under arteritis. Furthermore, there are many conditions that have vasculitis as an accompanying or atypical feature, including: - Rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and dermatomyositis - Cancer, such as lymphomas - Infections, such as hepatitis C - Exposure to chemicals and drugs, such as amphetamines, cocaine, and anthrax vaccines which contain the Anthrax Protective Antigen as the primary ingredient. In pediatric patients varicella inflammation may be followed by vasculitis of intracranial vessels. This condition is called post varicella angiopathy and this may be responsible for arterial ischaemic strokes in children. Several of these vasculitides are associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. These are: - Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis) - Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome) - Microscopic polyangiitis In this table: ANA = Antinuclear antibodies, CRP = C-reactive protein, ESR = Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate, dsDNA = double-stranded DNA, ENA = extractable nuclear antigens, RNP = ribonucleoproteins; VDRL = Venereal Disease Research Laboratory Treatments are generally directed toward stopping the inflammation and suppressing the immune system.

A history of heartburn, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and use of certain forms of medication can raise the suspicion for peptic ulcer. Medicines associated with peptic ulcer include NSAIDs (non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs) that inhibit cyclooxygenase, and most glucocorticoids (e. g. dexamethasone and prednisolone). In people over the age of 45 with more than two weeks of the above symptoms, the odds for peptic ulceration are high enough to warrant rapid investigation by esophagogastroduodenoscopy. The timing of the symptoms in relation to the meal may differentiate between gastric and duodenal ulcers: A gastric ulcer would give epigastric pain during the meal, as gastric acid production is increased as food enters the stomach. Symptoms of duodenal ulcers would initially be relieved by a meal, as the pyloric sphincter closes to concentrate the stomach contents, therefore acid is not reaching the duodenum. Duodenal ulcer pain would manifest mostly 2\u20133 hours after the meal, when the stomach begins to release digested food and acid into the duodenum. Also, the symptoms of peptic ulcers may vary with the location of the ulcer and the person's age. Furthermore, typical ulcers tend to heal and recur and as a result the pain may occur for few days and weeks and then wane or disappear. Usually, children and the elderly do not develop any symptoms unless complications have arisen. Burning or gnawing feeling in the stomach area lasting between 30 minutes and 3 hours commonly accompanies ulcers. This pain can be misinterpreted as hunger, indigestion or heartburn. Pain is usually caused by the ulcer but it may be aggravated by the stomach acid when it comes into contact with the ulcerated area. The pain caused by peptic ulcers can be felt anywhere from the navel up to the sternum, it may last from few minutes to several hours and it may be worse when the stomach is empty. Also, sometimes the pain may flare at night and it can commonly be temporarily relieved by eating foods that buffer stomach acid or by taking anti-acid medication. However, peptic ulcer disease symptoms may be different for every sufferer."}

Most likely a bladder spasm, it lasts about two hours. - Musculoskeletal abnormalities include pectus excavatum, scoliosis, and congenital joint dislocations including the hip. Diagnosis of prune belly syndrome necessitates a thorough orthopaedic evaluation because of the high prevalence of associated musculoskeletal abnormalities. Prune belly syndrome can result in distention and enlargement of internal organs such as the bladder and intestines. Surgery is often required but will not return the organs to a normal size. Bladder reductions have shown that the bladder will again stretch to its previous size due to lack of muscle. Complications may also arise from enlarged/malformed kidneys, which may result in renal failure and the child's going on dialysis or requiring a kidney transplant. With proper treatment, however, a longer, healthier life is possible. Prune belly syndrome can be diagnosed via ultrasound while a child is still in-utero. An abnormally large abdominal cavity resembling that of an obese person is the key indicator, as the abdomen swells with the pressure of accumulated urine. In young children, frequent urinary tract infections often herald prune belly syndrome, as they are normally uncommon. If a problem is suspected, doctors can perform blood tests to check renal function. Another study that may suggest the syndrome is a voiding cystourethrogram. PBS is far more common in males. Autosomal recessive inheritance has been suggested in some cases. A homozygous mutation in the muscarinic cholinergic receptor-3 gene (CHRM3) on chromosome 1q43 was reported in one family."}

Neurons affected by the altered protein accumulate excess neurofilaments in the axon, the long extension from the nerve cell that transmits its signal to other nerve cells and to muscles. These enlarged or 'giant' axons cannot transmit signals properly, and eventually deteriorate, resulting in the range of neurological anomalies associated with the disorder. This disease is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means the defective gene is located on an autosome, and both parents must have one copy of the defective gene in order to have a child born with the disorder. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers, but are usually not affected by the disorder. Giant axonal neuropathy usually appears in infancy or early childhood, and is progressive. Early signs of the disorder often present in the peripheral nervous system, causing individuals with this disorder to have problems walking. Later, normal sensation, coordination, strength, and reflexes become affected. Hearing or vision problems may also occur. Abnormally kinky hair is characteristic of giant axonal neuropathy, appearing in almost all cases. As the disorder progresses, central nervous system becomes involved, which may cause a gradual decline in mental function, loss of control of body movement, and seizures."}

In terms of diagnosis Bernard\u2013Soulier syndrome is characterized by prolonged bleeding time, thrombocytopenia, increased megakaryocytes, and enlarged platelets, Bernard\u2013Soulier syndrome is associated with quantitative or qualitative defects of the platelet glycoprotein complex GPIb/V/IX. The degree of thrombocytopenia may be estimated incorrectly, due to the possibility that when the platelet count is performed with automatic counters, giant platelets may reach the size of red blood cells. The large platelets and low platelet count in BSS are seemingly due to the absence of GPIb\u03b1 and the filamin A binding site that links the GPIb-IX-V complex to the platelet membrane skeleton. The differential diagnosis for Bernard\u2013Soulier syndrome includes both Glanzmann thrombasthenia and pediatric Von Willebrand disease. BSS platelets do not aggregate to ristocetin, and this defect is not corrected by the addition of normal plasma, distinguishing it from von Willebrand disease. In terms of treatment/management, bleeding events can be controlled by platelet transfusion. Most heterozygotes, with few exceptions, do not have a bleeding diathesis. BSS presents as a bleeding disorder due to the inability of platelets to bind and aggregate at sites of vascular endothelial injury. In the event of an individual with mucosal bleeding tranexamic acid can be given. The affected individual may need to avoid contact sports and medications such as aspirin, which can increase the possibility of bleeding. A potential complication is the possibility of the individual producing antiplatelet antibodies The frequency of Bernard\u2013Soulier syndrome is approximately 1 in 1,000,000 people.

Less commonly gastrointestinal or urinary infection can be the inciting agent. All of these infections have in common the activation of mucosal defenses and hence IgA antibody production. Groin pain can also occur. The gross hematuria resolves after a few days, though microscopic hematuria may persist. These episodes occur on an irregular basis every few months and in most patients eventually subsides, although it can take many years. Renal function usually remains normal, though rarely, acute kidney failure may occur (see below). This presentation is more common in younger adults. A smaller proportion (20-30%), usually the older population, have microscopic hematuria and proteinuria (less than 2 gram/day). These patients may not have any symptoms and are only clinically found if a physician decides to take a urine sample. Hence, the disease is more commonly diagnosed in situations where screening of urine is compulsory (e. g. , schoolchildren in Japan). Very rarely (5% each), the presenting history is: - Nephrotic syndrome (3-3. 5 grams of protein loss in the urine, associated with a poorer prognosis) - Acute kidney failure (either as a complication of the frank hematuria, when it usually recovers, or due to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis which often leads to chronic kidney failure) - Chronic kidney failure (no previous symptoms, presents with anemia, hypertension and other symptoms of kidney failure, in people who probably had longstanding undetected microscopic hematuria and/or proteinuria) A variety of systemic diseases are associated with IgA nephropathy such as liver failure, celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, reactive arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and HIV.

They can be as small as 1-5mm in diameter, but can also grow or spread into large masses in the genital or anal area. In some cases they look like small stalks. They may be hard (\"keratinized\") or soft. Their color can be variable, and sometimes they may bleed. In most cases, there are no symptoms of HPV infection other than the warts themselves. Sometimes warts may cause itching, redness, or discomfort, especially when they occur around the anus. Although they are usually without other physical symptoms, an outbreak of genital warts may cause psychological distress, such as anxiety, in some people. HPV is most commonly transmitted through penetrative sex. While HPV can also be transmitted via non-penetrative sexual activity, it is less transmissible than via penetrative sex. There is conflicting evidence about the effect of condoms on transmission of low-risk HPV. Some studies have suggested that they are effective at reducing transmission. Other studies suggest that condoms are not effective at preventing transmission of the low-risk HPV variants that cause genital warts. The effect of condoms on HPV transmission may also be gender-dependent; there is some evidence that condoms are more effective at preventing infection of males than of females. The types of HPV that cause warts are highly transmissible. Roughly three out of four unaffected partners of patients with warts develop them within eight months. Other studies of partner concordance suggest that the presence of visible warts may be an indicator of increased infectivity; HPV concordance rates are higher in couples where one partner has visible warts. Although 90% of HPV infections are cleared by the body within two years of infection, it is possible for infected cells to undergo a latency (quiet) period, with the first occurrence or a recurrence of symptoms happening months or years later."}

If there is doubt about the interpretation of the x-ray, stress x-rays, tomograms or CT scan may be used for confirmation. The reasons for non-union are - avascular necrosis (the blood supply was interrupted by the fracture) - the two ends are not apposed (that is, they are not next to each other) - infection (particularly osteomyelitis) - the fracture is not fixed (that is, the two ends are still mobile) - soft-tissue imposition (there is muscle or ligament covering the broken ends and preventing them from touching each other) Callus is formed, but the bone fractures have not joined. This can be due to inadequate fixation of the fracture, and treated with rigid immobilisation. No callus is formed. This is often due to impaired bony healing, for example due to vascular causes (e. g. impaired blood supply to the bone fragments) or metabolic causes (e. g. diabetes or smoking). Failure of initial union, for example when bone fragments are separated by soft tissue may also lead to atrophic non-union. Atrophic non-union can be treated by improving fixation, removing the end layer of bone to provide raw ends for healing, and the use of bone grafts. The diagnosis of nonunion is generally done when there is no progress between to occasions of medical imaging such as X-ray. This is generally the case after 6-8 months. Judet and Judet, Muller, Weber and Cech, and others classified nonunions into two types according to the viability of the ends of the fragments: Hypervascular nonunions and avascular nonunions. Hypervascular nonunions are subdivided as: 1. \"Elephant foot\" nonunions: These are hypertrophic, rich in callus and are a result of inadequate immobilisation, insecure fixation or premature weight bearing."}

Metastasis of early melanoma is possible, but relatively rare: less than a fifth of melanomas diagnosed early become metastatic. Brain metastases are particularly common in patients with metastatic melanoma. It can also spread to the liver, bones, abdomen or distant lymph nodes. Melanomas are usually caused by DNA damage resulting from exposure to ultraviolet light from the sun. Genetics also plays a role. Having more than fifty moles indicates an increased risk melanoma might arise. A weakened immune system makes it easier for cancer to arise due to the body\u2019s weakened ability to fight cancer cells. The ultraviolet radiation from tanning beds increases the risk of melanoma. The International Agency for Research on Cancer finds that tanning beds are \"carcinogenic to humans\" and that people who begin using tanning devices before the age of thirty years are 75% more likely to develop melanoma. Those who work in airplanes also appear to have an increased risk, believed to be due to greater exposure to UV. Ultraviolet UVB light (wavelengths between 315 \u2013 280 nm) from the sun is absorbed by skin cell DNA and results in a type of direct DNA damage called cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs). Thymine-thymine, cytosine-cytosine or cytosine-thymine dimers are formed by the joining of two adjacent pyrimidine bases within a DNA strand. Somewhat similarly to UVB, UVA light (longer wavelengths between 400 \u2013 315 nm) from the sun or from tanning beds can also be directly absorbed by skin DNA (at about 100 to 1000 fold lower efficiency than UVB is absorbed). Studies suggest that exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVA and UVB) is one of the major contributors to the development of melanoma. Occasional extreme sun exposure (resulting in \"sunburn\") is causally related to melanoma. Melanoma is most common on the back in men and on legs in women (areas of intermittent sun exposure). The risk appears to be strongly influenced by socio-economic conditions rather than indoor versus outdoor occupations; it is more common in professional and administrative workers than unskilled workers."}

The condition is frequently, but not always the result of a genetic disorder, and is more common in infants born to one or more parents with a malformed or absent kidney. This is much more common, but is not usually of any major health consequence, as long as the other kidney is healthy. It may be associated with an increased incidence of M\u00fcllerian duct abnormalities, which are abnormalities of the development of the female reproductive tract and can be a cause of infertility, blocked menstrual flow (hematocolpos), increased need for Caesarean sections, or other problems. Herlyn-Werner-Wunderlich syndrome is one such syndrome in which unilaterial renal agenesis is combined with a blind hemivagina and uterus didelphys.

Adults with unilateral renal agenesis have considerably higher chances of hypertension (high blood pressure). People with this condition are advised to approach contact sports with caution. The odds of a person being born with unilateral renal agenesis are approximately 1 in 750. In 2008 researchers found autosomal dominant mutations in the RET and GDNF genes to be linked to renal agenesis in unrelated stillborn fetuses through PCR and direct sequence analysis.

It is typically the result of aging, occurring in 2. 8% of the population over 75 years of age and represents the most common cause of outflow obstruction in the left ventricle. Stenosis is typically the result of valvular calcification, but may be the result of a congenitally malformed bicuspid aortic valve. This defect is characterized by the presence of only two valve leaflets and affects up to 1% of the population, making it one of the most common cardiac abnormalities. It may occur in isolation or in concert with other cardiac anomalies. Aortic insufficiency, or regurgitation, is characterized by an inability of the valve leaflets to appropriately close at end systole, thus allowing blood to flow inappropriately backwards into the left ventricle. Causes of aortic insufficiency in the majority of cases are unknown, or idiopathic. It may be the result of connective tissue or immune disorders, such as Marfan syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus, respectively. Processes that lead to aortic insufficiency usually involve dilation of the valve annulus, thus displacing the valve leaflets, which are anchored in the annulus. Mitral stenosis is caused largely by rheumatic heart disease, though is rarely the result of calcification. In some cases vegetations form on the mitral leaflets as a result of endocarditis, an inflammation of the heart tissue. Mitral stenosis is uncommon and not as age dependent as other types of valvular disease."}

The congenital form, teratologic or non-reducible dislocation occurs as part of more complex conditions. The condition can be bilateral or unilateral: - If both hip joints are affected one speaks of \"bilateral\" dysplasia. In this case some diagnostic indicators like asymmetric folds and leg-length inequality do not apply. - In unilateral dysplasia only one joint shows deformity, the contralateral side may show resulting effects. In the majority of unilateral cases the left hip has the dysplasia. If the joint is fully dislocated a false acetabulum often forms (often higher up on the pelvis) opposite the dislocated femoral head position. In acetabular dysplasia the acetabulum (socket) is too shallow or deformed. The center-edge angle is measured as described by Wiberg. Two forms of femoral dysplasia are coxa vara, in which the femur head grows at too narrow an angle to the shaft, and coxa valga, in which the angle is too wide. A rare type, the \"Beukes familial hip dysplasia\" is found among Afrikaners that are members of the Beukes family. The femur head is flat and irregular. People develop osteoarthritis at an early age. Hip dysplasia is considered to be a multifactorial condition. That means that several factors are involved in causing the condition to manifest. The cause of this condition is unknown; however, some factors of congenital hip dislocation are through heredity and racial background. It is also thought that the higher rates in some ethnic groups (such as some Native American groups) is due to the practice swaddling of infants, which is known to be a potential risk factor for developing dysplasia. It also has a low risk in African Americans and southern Chinese. Some studies suggest a hormonal link. Specifically, the hormone relaxin has been indicated."}

Research, imaging, and analysis has shown that distribution of polymicrogryia does not always appear to be random, which revealed different types polymicrogyria. A summary of clinical manifestations of each syndrome can be found below, in the section labelled \"Clinical presentation\". BFP appears to be a symmetrical polymicrogyria that extends anteriorly from the frontal poles to the posterior precentral gyrus, and inferiorly to the frontal operculum. Patients who had polymicrogyria distribution similar to this also experienced similar symptoms including delayed motor and language developments, spastic hemiparesis or quadriparesis, and forms of mild mental retardation. BFPP was one of the first discovered forms of polymicrogyria to have a gene identified linking to the syndromes caused. This gene is called GPR56. Symmetrical distribution is also evident in this form, but more distinctly, patients with BFPP were found to have atrophy of the cerebellum and brain stem, as well as bilateral white matter abnormalities. BFPP is characterized by estopia, global development delay, pyramidal signs, cerebral signs, and seizures. Estopia is also known as dysconjugate gaze, and is a common feature of severe static encephalopathy. This differentiates BFPP from the other bilatieral polymicrogyria syndromes. BPP is similar to the other types of polymicrogyria in that it is usually symmetrical, but BPP can vary among patients. BPP is characterized by its location; the cerebral cortex deep in the sylvian fissures is thickened and abnormally infolded, as well as the sylvian fissures extending more posteriorly up to the parietal lobes and more vertically oriented. BPP has been classified into a grading system consisting of four different grades that describe that variations in severity: Grade 1: Perisylvian polymicrogyria extends to either one or both poles Grade 2: Perisylvian polymicrogyria extends past the perisylvian region, but not to either of the polesGrade 3: Perisylvian polymicrogyria is contained in the perisylvian region onlyGrade 4: Perisylvian polymicrogyria is contained in the posterior perisylvian region onlyThe grades move from most severe (Grade 1) to least severe (Grade 4). Although BFPP was the first form of polymicrogyria to be discovered, BPP was the first form to be described and is also the most common form of polymicrogyria. The clinical characterizations of BPP \"include pseudobulbar palsy with diplegia of the facial, pharyngeal and masticory muscles (facio-pharyngo-glosso-masticatory paresis), pyramidal signs, and seizures. \" These can result in drooling, feeding issues, restricted tongue movement, and dysarthria. Disorders in language development have also been associated with BPP, but the extent of language disorder depends on the severity of cortical damage. Patients who suffer from BPP can also have pyramidal signs that vary in severity, and can be either unilateral or bilateral. BPOP is located in the parasagittal and mesial regions of the parieto-occipital cortex."}

These factors include both psychological and physical factors. Psychologically, possible causes of the disorder include the impact of childhood and adolescence experiences and current events \u2013 both within the individual and within the current relationship. There has been little investigation of the impact of individual factors on female sexual dysfunction. Such factors include stress, levels of fatigue, gender identity, health, and other individual attributes and experiences, such as dysfunctional sexual beliefs that may affect sexual desire or response. Over exposure to pornography-style media is also thought to lead to poor body image, self-consciousness and lowered self-esteem. An individual's sexual activity is disrupted by overwhelming emotional distress resulting in inability to attain sexual pleasure. Sexual dysfunction can also occur secondary to major psychiatric disorders, including depression. A substantial body of research has explored the role of interpersonal factors in female sexual dysfunction, particularly in relation to orgasmic response. These studies have largely focused on the impact of the quality of the relationship on the sexual functioning of the partners. Some studies have evaluated the role of specific relationship variables, whereas others have examined overall relationship satisfaction. Some studies have explored events, while others have focused on attitudes as an empirical measure of relationship functioning. Subject populations have varied from distressed couples to sexually dysfunctional clients to those in satisfied relationships. In addition to past experience and personal psychology, social context plays a factor: Estimates of the percentage of female sexual dysfunction attributable to physical factors have ranged from 30% to 80%. The disorders most likely to result in sexual dysfunction are those that lead to problems in circulatory or neurological function. These factors have been more extensively explored in men than in women. Physical etiologies such as neurological and cardiovascular illnesses have been directly implicated in both premature and retarded ejaculation as well as in erectile disorder, but the contribution of physiological factors to female sexual dysfunction is not so clear. However, recent literature does suggest that there may be an impairment in the arousal phase among diabetic women. Given that diabetic women show a significant variability in their response to this medical disorder, it is not surprising that the disease\u2019s influence on arousal is also highly variable. In fact, the lack of a clear association between medical disorders and sexual functioning suggests that psychological factors play a significant part in the impact of these disorders on sexual functioning."}

The pain is continuous and may be described as extreme, growing, sharp, shooting, or throbbing. Putting pressure or warmth on the tooth may induce extreme pain. The area may be sensitive to touch and possibly swollen as well. This swelling may be present at either the base of the tooth, the gum, and/or the cheek, and sometimes can be reduced by applying ice packs. An acute abscess may be painless but still have a swelling present on the gum. It is important to get anything that presents like this checked by a dental professional as it may become chronic later. In some cases, a tooth abscess may perforate bone and start draining into the surrounding tissues creating local facial swelling. In some cases, the lymph glands in the neck will become swollen and tender in response to the infection. It may even feel like a migraine as the pain can transfer from the infected area. The pain does not normally transfer across the face, only upwards or downwards as the nerves that serve each side of the face are separate. Severe aching and discomfort on the side of the face where the tooth is infected is also fairly common, with the tooth itself becoming unbearable to touch due to extreme amounts of pain. A periodontal abscess may be difficult to distinguish from a periapical abscess. Indeed, sometimes they can occur together. Since the management of a periodontal abscess is different from that of a periapical abscess, this differentiation is important to make. - If the swelling is over the area of the root apex, it is more likely to be a periapical abscess; if it is closer to the gingival margin, it is more likely to be a periodontal abscess. - Similarly, in a periodontal abscess pus most likely discharges via the periodontal pocket, whereas a periapical abscess generally drains via a parulis nearer to the apex of the involved tooth. - If the tooth has pre-existing periodontal disease, with pockets and loss of alveolar bone height, it is more likely to be a periodontal abscess; whereas if the tooth has relatively healthy periodontal condition, it is more likely to be a periapical abscess. - In periodontal abscesses, the swelling usually precedes the pain, and in periapical abscesses, the pain usually precedes the swelling."}

Therefore, its removal eliminates the risk of subsequent progression into a life-threatening condition. Some forms of CIS (e. g. , colon polyps and polypoid tumours of the bladder) can be removed using an endoscope, without conventional surgical resection. Dysplasia of the uterine cervix is removed by excision (cutting it out) or by burning with a laser. Bowen's disease of the skin is removed by excision. Other forms require major surgery, the best known being intraductal carcinoma of the breast (also treated with radiotherapy). One of the most dangerous forms of CIS is the \"pneumonic form\" of BAC of the lung, which can require extensive surgical removal of large parts of the lung. When too large, it often cannot be completely removed, with eventual disease progression and death of the patient."}

It can cause the kidneys to fail (end-stage renal disease, or ESRD) forcing a patient to start dialysis or receive a kidney transplant. In endemic areas BEN is responsible for up to 70% of ESRD. At least 25,000 individuals are known to have the disease. Symptoms include weakness, anemia, and a coppery skin discoloration A later finding, usually after kidney failure occurs, is transitional cancer of urothelial tract. While most urothelial cancer is in the bladder, BEN has an increased rate of the upper tract (renal pelvis and ureters). The cause of DEFN is not certain, although chronic exposure to dietary aristolochic acid has been identified as a major risk factor for DEFN and other, related disorders. In the Balkan region, dietary aristolochic acid exposure may come from the consumption of the seeds of Aristolochia clematitis (European birthwort), a plant native to the endemic region, which are thought to comingle with the wheat used for bread. This theory has recently been further supported by the research of cancer biologist Arthur P. Grollman, director of the chemical biology lab at Stony Brook University in New York, and his colleague Bojan Jelakovi\u0107, an associate professor at the Zagreb University School of Medicine. Aristolochic-acid-containing herbal remedies used in traditional Chinese medicine are associated with a related\u2014possibly identical\u2014condition known as \"Chinese herbs nephropathy\". Exposure to aristolochic acid is associated with a high incidence of uroepithelial tumorigenesis. The first official published description of the disease was made by the Bulgarian nephrologist Dr. Yoto Tanchev (1917\u20132000) and his team in 1956 in the Bulgarian Journal Savremenna Medizina, a priority generally acknowledged by the international nephrological community. Their study was based on a wide screening of inhabitants of the villages around the town of Vratsa, Bulgaria. Their contribution to the understanding of this unusual endemic disease of the kidneys was their description of symptoms which were not typical of common chronic nephritis, i. e. , incidence only in adults (no children affected), absence of high blood pressure, xanthochromia of palms and soles (Tanchev's sign), early hypochromic anemia, absence of proteinuria, and slow progression of kidney failure.

Crohn's disease is sometimes termed orofacial granulomatosis when it involves the mouth alone). - Sideropenic dysphagia can cause glossitis, angular cheilitis. Oesophageal diseases include a spectrum of disorders affecting the oesophagus. The most common condition of the oesophagus in Western countries is gastroesophageal reflux disease, which in chronic forms is thought to result in changes to the epithelium of the oesophagus, known as Barrett's oesophagus. Acute disease might include infections such as oesophagitis, trauma caused ingestion of corrosive substances, or rupture of veins such as oesophageal varices, Boerhaave syndrome or Mallory-Weiss tears. Chronic diseases might include congenital diseases such as Zenker's diverticulum and esophageal webbing, and oesophageal motility disorders including the nutcracker oesophagus, achalasia, diffuse oesophageal spasm, and oesophageal stricture. Oesophageal disease may result in a sore throat, throwing up blood, difficulty swallowing or vomiting. Chronic or congenital diseases might be investigated using barium swallows, endoscopy and biopsy, whereas acute diseases such as reflux may be investigated and diagnosed based on symptoms and a medical history alone. Gastric diseases refer to diseases affecting the stomach. Inflammation of the stomach by infection from any cause is called gastritis, and when including other parts of the gastrointestinal tract called gastroenteritis. When gastritis persists in a chronic state, it is associated with several diseases, including atrophic gastritis, pyloric stenosis, and gastric cancer."}

This syndrome is restricted to the face, but it can also cause underdeveloped or malformed kidneys. The disease is genetically inherited and stems from a mutation that deletes the TFAP2A gene. This gene is important because it provides the blueprint for the arrangement of 437 amino acids that make up the protein transcription factor known as AP-2 alpha. This protein transcription factor binds to a carboxy terminus helix-span-helix motifand an amino terminus portion of DNA that affects the activity of numerous cellular activities such as cell division and apoptosis. AP-2 alpha is especially important during the embyros development principally in the development of the branchial arches. Currently there are also four other proteins that are affected by the deletion of TFAP2A gene as well. One is L249P, this protein changes to cause a conformational space change with a substituted proline. Furthermore, a change in the R254W and R255G proteins results in a replacement of a charged polar side chain by a nonpolar side chain, and lastly, an alteration in the G262E protein results in a nonpolar side chain being replaced by a charged polar side chain. Branchio-oculo-facial syndrome is difficult to diagnose because it has incomplete penetrance. It is often misdiagnosed as branchio-oto-renal syndrome because of their similarities in symptoms. It was estimated that only about 50 cases of BOFS have been documented in the medical literature as of 2004."}

When an infant is born with an anorectal malformation, it is usually detected quickly as it is a very obvious defect. Doctors will then determine the type of birth defect the child was born with and whether or not there are any associated malformations. It is important to determine the presence of any associated defects during the newborn period in order to treat them early and avoid further sequelae. There are two main categories of anorectal malformations: those that require a protective colostomy and those that do not. The decision to open a colostomy is usually taken within the first 24 hours of birth. Sonography can be used to determine the type of imperforate anus. There are other forms of anorectal malformations though imperforate anus is most common. Other variants include anterior ectopic anus. This form is more commonly seen in females and presents with constipation. Imperforate anus usually requires immediate surgery to open a passage for feces unless a fistula can be relied on until corrective surgery takes place. Depending on the severity of the imperforate, it is treated either with a perineal anoplasty or with a colostomy. While many surgical techniques to definitively repair anorectal malformations have been described."}

Research supports that there are hereditary and acquired risk factors that can make one more susceptible to the defect. The disorder is generally more prevalent in males compared to females, and tends to occur earlier in males due to their involvement in more strenuous activities at a younger age. In a young athlete, the spine is still growing which means there are many ossification centers, leaving points of weakness in the spine. This leaves young athletes at increased risk, particularly when involved in repetitive hyperextension and rotation across the lumbar spine. Spondylolysis is a common cause of low back pain in preadolescents and adolescent athletes, as it accounts for about 50% of all low back pain. It is believed that both repetitive trauma and an inherent genetic weakness can make an individual more susceptible to spondylolysis. Sports involving repetitive or forceful hyperextension of the spine, especially when combined with rotation are the main mechanism of injury for spondylolysis. The stress fracture of the pars interarticularis occurs on the side opposite to activity. For instance, for a right-handed player, the fracture occurs on the left side of the vertebrae. Spondylolysis has a higher occurrence in the following activities: - Baseball - Tennis - Diving - Cheerleading - Gymnastics - Football - Soccer - Wrestling - Weightlifting - Roller Derby - Cricket - Pole Vault - Rugby - Volleyball - Gym - Ultimate Frisbee (especially during impact from laying out) Although this condition can be caused by repetitive trauma to the lumbar spine in strenuous sports, other risk factors can also predispose individuals to spondylolsis. Males are more commonly affected by spondylolysis than females. In one study looking at youth athletes, it was found that the mean age of individuals with spondylolisthesis was 20 years of age. Spondylolysis also runs in families suggesting a hereditary component such as a predisposition to weaker vertebrae. Spondylolysis is a bony defect or fracture within the pars interarticularis of the vertebral arch in the spinal column. The vast majority of spondylolysis occur in the lumbar vertebrae, however it can also be seen in cervical vertebrae. The lumbar vertebra consist of a body, pedicle, lamina, pars interarticularis, transverse process, spinous process and superior and inferior articular facets, which form joints that link the vertebrae together. When examining the vertebra, the pars interarticularis is the bony segment between the superior and inferior articular facet joints located anterior to the lamina and posterior to the pedicle."}

Clinical results may vary from mild diarrhea to a life-threatening sequence of severe abdominal pain, vomiting, bloody stool, ulceration of the small intestine with leakage (perforation) into the peritoneal cavity and possible death within a single day due to peritonitis. Many patients exhibit meteorism. Treatment involves suppressing the toxin-producing organisms with antibiotics such as penicillin G or metronidazole. About half of seriously ill patients require surgery for perforation, persistent intestinal obstruction, or failure to respond to the antibiotics. An investigational toxoid vaccine has been used successfully in some developing countries but is not available outside of research. All the factors collectively causing CNE are generally only present in the hinterlands of New Guinea and parts of Africa, Latin America, and Asia. These factors include protein deprivation (causing inadequate synthesis of trypsin protease (an enzyme), to which the toxin is very sensitive), poor food hygiene, episodic meat feasting, staple diets containing trypsin inhibitors (sweet potatoes), and infection by Ascaris parasites which secrete a trypsin inhibitor. In New Guinea (origin of the term \"pigbel\"), the disease is usually spread through contaminated meat (especially pork) and perhaps by peanuts. (CNE was also diagnosed in post World War II Germany, where it was known as Darmbrand or \"fire bowels\")."}

With milder levels of mania, known as hypomania, individuals are energetic, excitable, and may be highly productive. As hypomania worsens, individuals begin to exhibit erratic and impulsive behavior, often making poor decisions due to unrealistic ideas about the future, and sleep less. At the extreme, manic individuals can experience distorted or delusional beliefs about the universe, hallucinate, hear voices, to the point of psychosis. A depressive episode commonly follows an episode of mania. The biological mechanisms responsible for switching from a manic or hypomanic episode to a depressive episode, or vice versa, remain poorly understood. Mania is a distinct period of at least one week of elevated or irritable mood, which can range from euphoria to delirium, and those experiencing hypo- or mania may exhibit three or more of the following behaviors: speak in a rapid, uninterruptible manner, short attention span, racing thoughts, increased goal-oriented activities, agitation, or they may exhibit behaviors characterized as impulsive or high-risk, such as hypersexuality or excessive spending. To meet the definition for a manic episode, these behaviors must impair the individual's ability to socialize or work. If untreated, a manic episode usually lasts three to six months. People with hypomania or mania may experience a decreased need of sleep, impaired judgment, and speak excessively and very rapidly. Manic individuals often have a history of substance abuse developed over years as a form of \"self-medication\". At the more extreme, a person in a full blown manic state can experience psychosis; a break with reality, a state in which thinking is affected along with mood. They may feel unstoppable, or as if they have been \"chosen\" and are on a \"special mission\", or have other grandiose or delusional ideas. This may lead to violent behavior and, sometimes, hospitalization in an inpatient psychiatric hospital. The severity of manic symptoms can be measured by rating scales such as the Young Mania Rating Scale, though questions remain about the reliability of these scales. The onset of a manic or depressive episode is often foreshadowed by sleep disturbances. Mood changes, psychomotor and appetite changes, and an increase in anxiety can also occur up to three weeks before a manic episode develops. Hypomania is the milder form of mania, defined as at least four days of the same criteria as mania, but does not cause a significant decrease in the individual's ability to socialize or work, lacks psychotic features such as delusions or hallucinations, and does not require psychiatric hospitalization. Overall functioning may actually increase during episodes of hypomania and is thought to serve as a defense mechanism against depression by some. Hypomanic episodes rarely progress to full blown manic episodes."}

Placenta previa is an independent risk factor for placenta accreta. Additional reported risk factors for placenta accreta include maternal age and multiparity, other prior uterine surgery, prior uterine curettage, uterine irradiation, endometrial ablation, Asherman syndrome, uterine leiomyomata, uterine anomalies, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and smoking. The condition is increased in incidence by the presence of scar tissue i. e. Asherman's syndrome usually from past uterine surgery, especially from a past dilation and curettage, (which is used for many indications including miscarriage, termination, and postpartum hemorrhage), myomectomy, or caesarean section. A thin decidua can also be a contributing factor to such trophoblastic invasion. Some studies suggest that the rate of incidence is higher when the fetus is female. Other risk factors include low-lying placenta, anterior placenta, congenital or acquired uterine defects (such as uterine septa), leiomyoma, ectopic implantation of placenta (including cornual pregnancy). Pregnant women above 35 years of age who have had a Caesarian section and now have a placenta previa overlying the uterine scar have a 40% chance of placenta accreta. The placenta forms an abnormally firm and deep attachment to the uterine wall. There is absence of the decidua basalis and incomplete development of the Nitabuch's layer. There are three forms of placenta accreta, distinguishable by the depth of penetration. When the antepartum diagnosis of placenta accreta is made, it is usually based on ultrasound findings in the second or third trimester. Sonographic findings that may be suggestive of placenta accreta include: 1. Loss of normal hypoechoic retroplacental zone 2. Multiple vascular lacunae (irregular vascular spaces) within placenta, giving \"Swiss cheese\" appearance 3.

{"input": "Children with Liddle syndrome are frequently asymptomatic. The first indication of the syndrome often is the incidental finding of hypertension during a routine physical exam.", "language": "en", "domain": "disease", "full_context": "Children with Liddle syndrome are frequently asymptomatic. The first indication of the syndrome often is the incidental finding of hypertension during a routine physical exam. Because this syndrome is rare, it may only be considered by the treating physician after the child's hypertension does not respond to medications for lowering blood pressure. Adults could present with nonspecific symptoms of low blood potassium, which can include weakness, fatigue, palpitations or muscular weakness (shortness of breath, constipation/abdominal distention or exercise intolerance). Additionally, long-standing hypertension could become symptomatic. This syndrome is caused by dysregulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) due to a genetic mutation at the 16p13-p12 locus. These channels are found on the surface of epithelial cells found in the kidneys, lungs, and sweat glands. The ENaC channel transports sodium into cells. The mutation changes a domain in the channel so it is no longer degraded correctly by the ubiquitin proteasome system. Specifically, the PY motif in the protein is deleted or altered so the E3 ligase (Nedd4) no longer recognizes the channel. This loss of ability to be degraded leads to high amounts of the channel being chronically present in the collecting duct. This results in a hyperaldosteronism-like state, since aldosterone is typically responsible for creating and inserting these channels. The increased sodium resorption leads to increased resorption of water, and hypertension due to an increase in extracellular volume. Evaluation of a child with persistent high blood pressure usually involves analysis of blood electrolytes and an aldosterone level, as well as other tests. In Liddle's disease, the serum sodium is typically elevated, the serum potassium is reduced, and the serum bicarbonate is elevated. These findings are also found in hyperaldosteronism, another rare cause of hypertension in children. Primary hyperaldosteronism (also known as Conn's syndrome), is due to an aldosterone-secreting adrenal tumor (adenoma) or adrenal hyperplasia. Aldosterone levels are high in hyperaldosteronism, whereas they are low to normal in Liddle syndrome. A genetic study of the ENaC sequences can be requested to detect mutations (deletions, insertions, missense mutations) and get a diagnosis. The treatment is with a low sodium (low salt) diet and a potassium-sparing diuretic that directly blocks the sodium channel."}

People with lipodermatosclerosis have tapering of their legs above the ankles, forming a constricting band resembling an inverted champagne bottle. In addition, there may be brownish-red pigmentation and induration. The exact cause of lipodermatosclerosis is unknown. Venous disease, such as venous incompetence, venous hypertension, and body mass (obesity) may be relevant to the underlying pathogenesis. Increased blood pressure in the veins (venous hypertension) can cause diffusion of substances, including fibrin, out of capillaries. Fibrotic tissue may predispose the tissue to ulceration. Recurrent ulceration and fat necrosis is associated with lipodermatosclerosis. In advanced lipodermatosclerosis the proximal leg swells from chronic venous obstruction and the lower leg shrinks from chronic ulceration and fat necrosis resulting in the inverted coke bottle appearance of the lower leg. Lipodermatosclerosis is most commonly diagnosed in middle-aged women. The origin of lipodermatosclerosis is probably multifactorial, involving tissue hypoxia, leakage of proteins into the interstitium, and leukocyte activation. Studies of patients with lipodermatosclerosis have demonstrated significantly decreased concentrations of cutaneous oxygen associated with decreased capillary density. Capillaries are virtually absent in areas of fibrotic scars, leading to a condition known as atrophie blanche or livedoid vasculopathy. Diagnosis is clinical, based on observation. Biopsy is rarely required. The management of lipodermatosclerosis may include treating venous insufficiency with leg elevation and elastic compression stockings; in some difficult cases, the condition may be improved with the additional use of the fibrinolytic agent, stanozol. Fibrinolytic agents use an enzymatic action to help dissolve blood clots. Stanozol is injected directly into the affected area, Venous Ablation has also been known to help circulation in patients."}

Often a person who has experienced depersonalization claims that things seem unreal or hazy. Also, a recognition of a self breaks down (hence the name). Depersonalization can result in very high anxiety levels, which further increase these perceptions. Depersonalization is a subjective experience of unreality in one's self, while derealization is unreality of the outside world. Although most authors currently regard depersonalization (self) and derealization (surroundings) as independent constructs, many do not want to separate derealization from depersonalization. Depersonalization is the third most common psychological symptom, after feelings of anxiety and feelings of depression. Depersonalization is a symptom of anxiety disorders, such as panic disorder. It can also accompany sleep deprivation (often occurring when suffering from jet lag), migraine, epilepsy (especially temporal lobe epilepsy), obsessive-compulsive disorder, stress, anxiety, and some cases of low latent inhibition. Interoceptive exposure is a non-pharmacological method that can be used to induce depersonalization. A similar and overlapping concept called ipseity disturbance (ipse is Latin for \"self\" or \"itself\") may be part of the core process of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. However, specific to the schizophrenia spectrum seems to be \"a dislocation of first-person perspective such that self and other or self and world may seem to be non-distinguishable, or in which the individual self or field of consciousness takes on an inordinate significance in relation to the objective or intersubjective world\" (emphasis in original). For the purposes of evaluation and measurement depersonalisation can be conceived of as a construct and scales are now available to map its dimensions in time and space. A study of undergraduate students found that individuals high on the depersonalization/derealization subscale of the Dissociative Experiences Scale exhibited a more pronounced cortisol response. Individuals high on the absorption subscale, which measures a subject's experiences of concentration to the exclusion of awareness of other events, showed weaker cortisol responses. Depersonalization has been described by some as a desirable state, particularly by those that have experienced it under the influence of mood-altering recreational drugs. It is an effect of dissociatives and psychedelics, as well as a possible side effect of caffeine, alcohol, amphetamine, and cannabis. It is a classic withdrawal symptom from many drugs. Benzodiazepine dependence, which can occur with long-term use of benzodiazepines, can induce chronic depersonalization symptomatology and perceptual disturbances in some people, even in those who are taking a stable daily dosage, and it can also become a protracted feature of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome."}

The actual incidence is likely higher, because those affected are asymptomatic. A diagnosis of essential fructosuria is typically made after a positive test for reducing substances in the urine. The excretion of fructose in the urine is not constant, it depends largely on dietary intake. No treatment is indicated for essential fructosuria, while the degree of fructosuria depends on the dietary fructose intake, it does not have any clinical manifestations. The amount of fructose routinely lost in urine is quite small. Other errors in fructose metabolism have greater clinical significance. Hereditary fructose intolerance, or the presence of fructose in the blood (fructosemia), is caused by a deficiency of aldolase B, the second enzyme involved in the metabolism of fructose. This enzyme deficiency results in an accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate, which inhibits the production of glucose and results in diminished regeneration of adenosine triphosphate. Clinically, patients with hereditary fructose intolerance are much more severely affected than those with essential fructosuria, with elevated uric acid, growth abnormalities and can result in coma if untreated."}

Leukemic cells are invariably present in samples of peripheral blood to a variable extent. Pancytopenia (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) is commonly seen as well. The leukemic cells have a diameter mildly greater than a large granular lymphocyte (LGL) and have azurophilic granules and nucleoli of varying prominence. Nuclei may be irregular and hyperchromatic. Bone marrow involvement runs the spectrum between an inconspicuous infiltrate to extensive marrow replacement by leukemic cells. Reactive histiocytes displaying hemophagocytosis can be seen interspersed in the neoplastic infiltrate. Leukemic involvement of organs is typically destructive on tissue sections with necrosis and possibly angioinvasion, and the monotonous infiltrate may be diffuse or patchy.

Warm compresses should be placed initially on the site to help diffuse the contrast medium, and cold compresses are used later to help reduce the swelling. - If, for the extravasated medication, substance-specific measures apply, carry them out (e. g. topical cooling, DMSO, hyaluronidase or dexrazoxane may be appropriate). - Recent clinical trials have shown that Totect (USA) or Savene (Europe) (dexrazoxane for extravasation) is effective in preventing the progression of anthracycline extravasation into progressive tissue necrosis."}

Symptoms include exercise intolerance with muscle pain, early fatigue, painful cramps, and myoglobin in the urine (often provoked by a bout of exercise). Myoglobinuria may result from the breakdown of skeletal muscle known as rhabdomyolysis, a condition in which muscle cells breakdown, sending their contents into the bloodstream. Patients may exhibit a \u201csecond wind\u201d phenomenon. This is characterized by the patient\u2019s better tolerance for aerobic exercise such as walking and cycling after approximately 10 minutes. This is attributed to the combination of increased blood flow and the ability of the body to find alternative sources of energy, like fatty acids and proteins. In the long term, patients may exhibit renal failure due to the myoglobinuria, and with age, patients may exhibit progressively increasing weakness and substantial muscle loss. Patients may present at emergency rooms with severe fixed contractures of the muscles and often severe pain. These require urgent assessment for rhabdomyolysis as in about 30% of cases this leads to acute renal failure. Left untreated this can be life-threatening. In a small number of cases compartment syndrome has developed, requiring prompt surgical referral. There are two autosomal recessive forms of this disease, childhood-onset and adult-onset. The gene for myophosphorylase, PYGM (the muscle-type of the glycogen phosphorylase gene), is located on chromosome 11q13. According to the most recent publications, 95 different mutations have been reported. The forms of the mutations may vary between ethnic groups. For example, the R49X (Arg49Stop) mutation is most common in North America and western Europe, and the Y84X mutation is most common among central Europeans. The exact method of protein disruption has been elucidated in certain mutations. For example, R138W is known to disrupt to pyridoxal phosphate binding site. In 2006, another mutation (c. 13_14delCT) was discovered which may contribute to increased symptoms in addition to the common Arg50Stop mutation."}

For example, deficiencies of iron, vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B3 (niacin), vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), vitamin B9 (folic acid) or vitamin B12 (cobalamine) may all manifest as stomatitis. Iron is necessary for the upregulation of transcriptional elements for cell replication and repair. Lack of iron can cause genetic downregulation of these elements, leading to ineffective repair and regeneration of epithelial cells, especially in the mouth and lips. Many disorders which cause malabsorption can cause deficiencies, which in turn causes stomatitis. Examples include tropical sprue. Aphthous stomatitis (canker sores) is the recurrent appearance of mouth ulcers in otherwise healthy individuals. The cause is not completely understood, but it is thought that the condition represents a T cell mediated immune response which is triggered by a variety of factors. The individual ulcers (aphthae) recur periodically and heal completely, although in the more severe forms new ulcers may appear in other parts of the mouth before the old ones have finished healing. Aphthous stomatitis is one of the most common diseases of the oral mucosa, and is thought to affect about 20% of the general population to some degree. The symptoms range from a minor nuisance to being disabling in their impact on eating, swallowing and talking, and the severe forms can cause people to lose weight. There is no cure for aphthous stomatitis, and therapies are aimed at alleviating the pain, reducing the inflammation and promoting healing of the ulcers, but there is little evidence of efficacy for any treatment that has been used. Inflammation of the corners (angles) of the lips is termed angular stomatitis or angular cheilitis. In children a frequent cause is repeated lip-licking, and in adults it may be a sign of underlying iron deficiency anemia, or vitamin B deficiencies (e. g. , B-riboflavin, B-folate, or B-cobalamin, which in turn may be evidence of poor diets or malnutrition such as celiac disease). Also, angular cheilitis can be caused by a patient's jaws at rest being 'overclosed' due to edentulousness or tooth wear, causing the jaws to come to rest closer together than if the complete/unaffected dentition were present. This causes skin folds around the angle of the mouth which are kept moist by saliva, which in turn favours infection; mostly by Candida albicans or similar species. Treatment usually involves the administration of topical nystatin or similar antifungal agents. Another treatment can be to correct the jaw relationship with dental treatment (e."}

According to Science Daily, \"Gravity plays a major role in our spatial orientation. Changes in gravitational forces, such as the transition to weightlessness during a space voyage, influence our spatial orientation and require adaptation by many of the physiological processes in which our balance system plays a part. As long as this adaptation is incomplete, this can be coupled to motion sickness (nausea), visual illusions and disorientation. \" Modern motion-sickness medications can counter space sickness but are rarely used because it is considered better to allow space travelers to adapt naturally over the first day or two than to suffer the drowsiness and other side effects of medication. However, transdermal dimenhydrinate anti-nausea patches are typically used whenever space suits are worn because vomiting into a space suit could be fatal, as it could obscure vision or block airflow. Space suits are generally worn during launch and landing by NASA crew members and always for extra-vehicular activities (EVAs). EVAs are consequently not usually scheduled for the first days of a mission to allow the crew to adapt, and transdermal dimenhydrinate patches are typically used as an additional backup measure. Space motion sickness was effectively unknown during the earliest spaceflights as these were undertaken in very cramped conditions; it seems to be aggravated by being able to freely move around and so is more common in larger spacecraft. After the Apollo 8 and Apollo 9 flights, where astronauts reported space motion sickness to Mission Control and then were subsequently removed from the flight list, astronauts (e. g. the Skylab 4 crew) attempted to prevent Mission Control from learning about their own SAS experience, apparently out of concern for their future flight assignment potential. As with sea sickness and car sickness, space motion sickness symptoms can vary from mild nausea and disorientation, to vomiting and intense discomfort; headaches and nausea are often reported in varying degrees. About half of sufferers experience mild symptoms; only around 10% suffer severely. The most extreme reaction yet recorded was that felt by Senator Jake Garn in 1985. After his flight NASA jokingly began using the informal \"Garn scale\" to measure reactions to space sickness. In most cases, symptoms last from 2\u20134 days. In an interview with Carol Butler, when asked about the origins of \"Garn\", Robert E. Stevenson was quoted as saying: Jake Garn was sick, was pretty sick.

Also typical is the broad range of seizures that can occur, larger than that of any other epileptic syndrome. The most frequently occurring seizure type is tonic seizures, which are often nocturnal (90%); the second most frequent are myoclonic seizures, which often occur when the person is over-tired. Atonic, atypical absence, tonic, complex partial, focalized and tonic\u2013clonic seizures are also common. Additionally, about half of patients will have status epilepticus, usually the nonconvulsive type, which is characterized by dizziness, apathy, and unresponsiveness. The seizures can cause sudden falling (or spasms in tonic, atonic and myoclonic episodes) and/or loss of balance, which is why patients often wear a helmet to prevent head injury. In addition to daily multiple seizures of various types, children with LGS frequently have arrested/slowed psycho-motor development and behavior disorders. The syndrome is also characterized by an interictal (between-seizures) EEG featuring slow spike-wave complexes. There is no uniform cause: in 20% of those affected, the LGS develops from West syndrome. The medical history frequently includes infantile spasms or focal and generalized seizures. The most common type of LGS (70\u201378%) is symptomatic (secondary) - that is an identifiable underlying pathology is responsible.

The two main types of human skin are glabrous skin, the nonhairy skin on the palms and soles (also referred to as the \"palmoplantar\" surfaces), and hair-bearing skin. Within the latter type, hairs in structures called pilosebaceous units have a hair follicle, sebaceous gland, and associated arrector pili muscle. In the embryo, the epidermis, hair, and glands are from the ectoderm, which is chemically influenced by the underlying mesoderm that forms the dermis and subcutaneous tissues. The epidermis is the most superficial layer of skin, a squamous epithelium with several strata: the stratum corneum, stratum lucidum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum basale. Nourishment is provided to these layers via diffusion from the dermis, since the epidermis is without direct blood supply. The epidermis contains four cell types: keratinocytes, melanocytes, Langerhans cells, and Merkel cells. Of these, keratinocytes are the major component, constituting roughly 95% of the epidermis. This stratified squamous epithelium is maintained by cell division within the stratum basale, in which differentiating cells slowly displace outwards through the stratum spinosum to the stratum corneum, where cells are continually shed from the surface. In normal skin, the rate of production equals the rate of loss; about two weeks are needed for a cell to migrate from the basal cell layer to the top of the granular cell layer, and an additional two weeks to cross the stratum corneum. The dermis is the layer of skin between the epidermis and subcutaneous tissue, and comprises two sections, the papillary dermis and the reticular dermis. The superficial papillary dermis interdigitates with the overlying rete ridges of the epidermis, between which the two layers interact through the basement membrane zone. Structural components of the dermis are collagen, elastic fibers, and ground substance also called extra fibrillar matrix. Within these components are the pilosebaceous units, arrector pili muscles, and the eccrine and apocrine glands. The dermis contains two vascular networks that run parallel to the skin surface\u2014one superficial and one deep plexus\u2014which are connected by vertical communicating vessels. The function of blood vessels within the dermis is fourfold: to supply nutrition, to regulate temperature, to modulate inflammation, and to participate in wound healing. The subcutaneous tissue is a layer of fat between the dermis and underlying fascia. This tissue may be further divided into two components, the actual fatty layer, or panniculus adiposus, and a deeper vestigial layer of muscle, the panniculus carnosus. The main cellular component of this tissue is the adipocyte, or fat cell. The structure of this tissue is composed of septal (i."}

New kinds of phobias have emerged (the so-called techno-phobias). Since the first mobile phone was introduced to the consumer market in 1983, these devices have become significantly mainstream in the majority of societies. Shambare, Rugimbana & Zhowa (2012) claimed that cell phones are \"possibly the biggest non-drug addiction of the 21st century\", and that colleges students may spend up to nine hours every day on their phones, which can lead to dependence on such technologies as a driver of modern life and an example of \"a paradox of technology\". that is both freeing and enslaving. A survey conducted by SecurEnvoy showed that young adults and adolescents are more likely to suffer from nomophobia. The same survey reported that 77% of the teens reported anxiety and worries when they were without their mobile phones, followed by the 25-34 age group and people over 55 years old. Some psychological predictors to look for in a person who might be suffering of this phobia are \"self negative views, younger age, low esteem and self-efficacy, high extroversion or introversion, impulsiveness and sense of urgency and sensation seeking\". Among students, frequent cell phone usage has been correlated with decreases in grade point average (GPA) and increased anxiety that negatively impacts self-reported life satisfaction (well-being and happiness) in comparison to students with less frequent usage. GPA decreases may be due to the over-use of cell phone or computer usage consuming time and focus during studying, attending class, working on assignments, and the distraction of cell phones during class. Over-usage of cell phones may increase anxiety due to the pressure to be continually connected to social networks and could rob chances of perceived solitude, relieving daily stress, that has been linked as a component of well-being. In Australia 946 adolescents and emerging adults between ages 15 and 24 participated in a mobile phone research study (387 males, 557 females, and two chose not to report a gender). The study focused on the relationship between the participants' frequency of mobile phone use and psychological involvement with their mobile phone. Researchers assessed several psychological factors that might influence participants' mobile phone use with the following questionnaires: Mobile Phone Involvement Questionnaire (MPIQ), Frequency of Mobile Phone Use, Self Identity, and Validation from others. The MPIQ assessed behavioral addictions using a seven-point Likert scale (1 \u2013 strongly agree) and (7 \u2013 strongly disagree) that included statements such as: \"I often think about my mobile phone when I am not using it.

No pathological conditions were found, but there was an excessive use of mobile phone indicating signs of attachment. Participants who demonstrated signs of excessive mobile phone use were more likely to increase their use when receiving validation from others. Other factors considered, the population studied was focused on adolescents and emerging adults are more likely to develop mobile phone dependency because they may be going through a self-identity, self-esteem, and social identity."}

Later in the disease process, there is painless increasing loss of range of motion of the affected fingers. The earliest sign of a contracture is a triangular \u201cpuckering\u201d of the skin of the palm as it passes over the flexor tendon just before the flexor crease of the finger, at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. Generally, the cords or contractures are painless, but, rarely, tenosynovitis can occur and produce pain. The most common finger to be affected is the ring finger; the thumb and index finger are much less often affected. The disease begins in the palm and moves towards the fingers, with the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints affected before the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints. In Dupuytren's contracture, the palmar fascia within the hand becomes abnormally thick, which can cause the fingers to curl and can impair finger function. The main function of the palmar fascia is to increase grip strength; thus, over time, Dupuytren's contracture decreases a person's ability to hold objects. People may report pain, aching and itching with the contractions. Normally, the palmar fascia consists of collagen type I, but in Dupuytren sufferers, the collagen changes to collagen type III, which is significantly thicker than collagen type I. People with severe involvement often show lumps on the back of their finger joints (called \u201cGarrod's pads\u201d, \u201cknuckle pads\u201d, or \u201cdorsal Dupuytren nodules\u201d) and lumps in the arch of the feet (plantar fibromatosis or Ledderhose disease).

It is often associated with other symptoms such as knuckle pads and Ledderhose disease. This type is sometimes known as Dupuytren's diathesis. - Type 2: The more normal type of Dupuytren's disease, usually found in the palm only, and which generally begins above the age of 50. According to Dr Eaton, this type may be made more severe by other factors such as diabetes or heavy manual labour. - Type 3: A mild form of Dupuytren's which is common among diabetics or which may also be caused by certain medications such as the anti-convulsants taken by people with epilepsy."}

Commonly used low molecular weight heparins are enoxaparin, dalteparin, nadroparin and tinzaparin. In HIT, the platelet count in the blood falls below the normal range, a condition called thrombocytopenia. However, it is generally not low enough to lead to an increased risk of bleeding. Most people with HIT will therefore not experience any symptoms. Typically the platelet count will fall 5\u201314 days after heparin is first given; if someone has received heparin in the previous three months, the fall in platelet count may occur sooner, sometimes within a day. The most common symptom of HIT is enlargement or extension of a previously diagnosed blood clot, or the development of a new blood clot elsewhere in the body. This may take the form of clots either in arteries or veins, causing arterial or venous thrombosis, respectively. Examples of arterial thrombosis are stroke, myocardial infarction (\"heart attack\"), and acute leg ischemia. Venous thrombosis may occur in the leg or arm in the form of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and in the lung in the form of a pulmonary embolism (PE); the latter usually originate in the leg but migrate to the lung. In those receiving heparin through an intravenous infusion, a complex of symptoms (\"systemic reaction\") may occur when the infusion is started. These include fever, chills, high blood pressure, a fast heart rate, shortness of breath, and chest pain. This happens in about a quarter of people with HIT. Others may develop a skin rash consisting of red spots. Heparin occurs naturally in the human body, but the development of HIT antibodies suggests heparin may act as a hapten, and thus be targeted by the immune system. In HIT, the immune system forms antibodies against heparin when it is bound to a protein called platelet factor 4 (PF4). These antibodies are usually of the IgG class and their development usually takes about five days. However, those who have been exposed to heparin in the last few months may still have circulating IgG, as IgG-type antibodies generally continue to be produced even when their precipitant has been removed. This is similar to immunity against certain microorganisms, with the difference that the HIT antibody does not persist more than three months."}

People with mild ID are capable of learning reading and mathematics skills to approximately the level of a typical child aged nine to twelve. They can learn self-care and practical skills, such as cooking or using the local mass transit system. As individuals with intellectual disability reach adulthood, many learn to live independently and maintain gainful employment. Moderate ID (IQ 35\u201349) is nearly always apparent within the first years of life. Speech delays are particularly common signs of moderate ID. People with moderate intellectual disability need considerable supports in school, at home, and in the community in order to fully participate. While their academic potential is limited, they can learn simple health and safety skills and to participate in simple activities. As adults, they may live with their parents, in a supportive group home, or even semi-independently with significant supportive services to help them, for example, manage their finances. As adults, they may work in a sheltered workshop. People with severe or profound ID need more intensive support and supervision their entire lives.

However, this has not been found to be the case. This may be in part because FSH, via stimulation of granulosa cells and the resultant secretion of yet-unidentified paracrine factors (but possibly including inhibin B), has been shown to significantly enhance the LH-mediated stimulation of androgen production by theca cells. In addition, theca cells predominantly secrete the relatively weak androgen androstenedione, whereas granulosa cells, signaled to do so by FSH under normal circumstances, convert androstenedione into its more potent relative testosterone (which is subsequently converted into estradiol). Hence, in females, FSH insensitivity may not only result in deficiencies in estrogen production by granulosa cells, but in diminished androgen synthesis by both theca and granulosa cells as well, which could potentially explain why hyperandrogenism does not occur. FSH insensitivity presents itself in females as two clusters of symptoms: 1) hypergonadotropic hypogonadism or hypoestrogenism, resulting in a delayed, reduced, or fully absent puberty and associated sexual infantilism (if left untreated), reduced uterine volume, and osteoporosis; and 2) ovarian dysgenesis or failure, resulting in primary or secondary amenorrhea, infertility, and normal sized to slightly enlarged ovaries. Males on the other hand are significantly less affected, presenting merely with partial or complete infertility, reduced testicular volume, and oligozoospermia (reduced spermatogenesis). FSH insensitivity is caused by inactivating mutations of the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) and thus an insensitivity of the receptor to FSH. This results in an inability of the granulosa cells in ovarian follicles to respond to FSH in females, in turn resulting in diminished estrogen production by the ovaries and loss of menstrual cycles, and an inability of Sertoli cells in the seminiferous tubules of the testicles to respond to FSH in males, which in turn results in impaired spermatogenesis. Hormone replacement therapy with estrogen may be used to treat symptoms of hypoestrogenism in females with the condition. There are currently no known treatments for the infertility caused by the condition in either sex."}

Initial symptoms include feeding intolerance, increased gastric residuals, abdominal distension and bloody stools. Symptoms may progress rapidly to abdominal discoloration with intestinal perforation and peritonitis and systemic hypotension requiring intensive medical support. The diagnosis is usually suspected clinically but often requires the aid of diagnostic imaging modalities, most commonly radiography. Specific radiographic signs of NEC are associated with specific Bell's stages of the disease: Bell's stage 1/Suspected disease: - Mild systemic disease (apnea, lethargy, bradycardia, temperature instability) - Mild intestinal signs (abdominal distention, increased gastric residuals, bloody stools) - Non-specific or normal radiological signs Bell's stage 2/Definite disease: - Mild to moderate systemic signs - Additional intestinal signs (absent bowel sounds, abdominal tenderness) - Specific radiologic signs (pneumatosis intestinalis or portal venous air) - Laboratory changes (metabolic acidosis, thrombocytopaenia) Bell's stage 3/Advanced disease: - Severe systemic illness (hypotension) - Additional intestinal signs (striking abdominal distention, peritonitis) - Severe radiologic signs (pneumoperitoneum) - Additional laboratory changes (metabolic and respiratory acidosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation) More recently ultrasonography has proven to be useful as it may detect signs and complications of NEC before they are evident on radiographs, specifically in cases that involve a paucity of bowel gas, a gasless abdomen, or a sentinel loop. Diagnosis is ultimately made in 5\u201310% of very low-birth-weight infants (<1,500g). Treatment consists primarily of supportive care including providing bowel rest by stopping enteral feeds, gastric decompression with intermittent suction, fluid repletion to correct electrolyte abnormalities and third-space losses, support for blood pressure, parenteral nutrition, and prompt antibiotic therapy. Monitoring is clinical, although serial supine and left lateral decubitus abdominal x-rays should be performed every six hours. Where the disease is not halted through medical treatment alone, or when the bowel perforates, immediate emergency surgery to resect the dead bowel is generally required, although abdominal drains may be placed in very unstable infants as a temporizing measure. Surgery may require a colostomy, which may be able to be reversed at a later time. Some children may suffer from short bowel syndrome if extensive portions of the bowel had to be removed. Once a child is born prematurely, thought must be given to decreasing the risk for developing NEC. Toward that aim, the methods of providing hyperalimentation and oral feeds are both important. In a 2012 policy statement, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended feeding preterm infants human milk, finding \"significant short- and long-term beneficial effects,\" including reducing the rate of NEC by a factor of two or more. A study by researchers in Peoria, IL, published in Pediatrics in 2008, demonstrated that using a higher rate of lipid (fats and/or oils) infusion for very low birth weight infants in the first week of life resulted in zero infants developing NEC in the experimental group, compared with 14% with NEC in the control group. (They started the experimental group at 2 g/kg/d of 20% IVFE and increased within two days to 3 g/kg/d; amino acids were started at 3 g/kg/d and increased to 3. 5. ) Neonatologists at the University of Iowa reported on the importance of providing small amounts of trophic oral feeds of human milk starting as soon as possible, while the infant is being primarily fed intravenously, in order to prime the immature gut to mature and become ready to receive greater oral intake."}

Later, the symptoms may be that of biliary and stomach obstruction. Of note, Courvoisier's law states that in the presence of a palpably enlarged gallbladder which is nontender and accompanied with mild painless jaundice, the cause is unlikely to be gallstones. This implicates possible malignancy of the gallbladder or pancreas, and the swelling is unlikely due to gallstones due to the chronic inflammation association with gallstones leading to a shunken, non-distensible gallbladder. However, Ludwig Georg Courvoisier's original observations, published in Germany in 1890, were not originally cited as a 'law', and no mention of malignancy or pain (tenderness) was made. These points are commonly missquoted or confused in the medical literature. Early diagnosis is not generally possible. People at high risk, such as women or Native Americans with gallstones, are evaluated closely. Transabdominal ultrasound, CT scan, endoscopic ultrasound, MRI, and MR cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP) can be used for diagnosis. A biopsy is the only certain way to tell whether the tumorous growth is malignant or not. Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC) is a rare form of gallbladder disease which mimics gallbladder cancer although it is not cancerous. It was first discovered and reported in the medical literature in 1976 by J. J. McCoy, Jr. , and colleagues. The most common and most effective treatment is surgical removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) with part of liver and lymph node dissection. However, with gallbladder cancer's extremely poor prognosis, most patients will die within a year of surgery. If surgery is not possible, endoscopic stenting of the biliary tree can reduce jaundice and a stent in stomach may relieve vomiting. Chemotherapy and radiation may also be used with surgery. If gall bladder cancer is diagnosed after cholecystectomy for stone disease (incidental cancer), reoperation to remove part of liver and lymph nodes is required in most cases."}

Premature ejaculation and impotence are commonly seen. Other somatic symptoms like weakness, easy fatiguability, palpitations, insomnia, low mood, guilt and anxiety are often present. Males sometimes report a subjective feeling that their penises have shortened. These symptoms are usually associated with an anxious and dysphoric mood state. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the mainstay of treatment. At other times counseling, anti-anxiety and antidepressant medications have been shown to be of use. The term Dhat gets its origin from the Sanskrit word Dhatu (\u0927\u093e\u0924\u0941), which, according to the Sushruta Samhita, means \"elixir that constitutes the body\". Indian doctor Narendra Wig coined the term Dhat syndrome in 1960 and described it as being characterized by vague psychosomatic symptoms of fatigue, weakness, anxiety, loss of appetite, guilt, and sexual dysfunction, attributed by the patient to loss of semen in nocturnal emission, through urine or masturbation. Literature describing semen as a vital constituent of the human body dates back to 1500 BC. The disorders of Dhatus have been elucidated in the Charaka Samhita, which describes a disorder called Shukrameha (\u0936\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e\u0947\u0939) in which there is a passage of semen in the urine. In China, various names such as (Shen K'uei), Sri Lanka (Prameha) and other parts of South East Asia (Jiryan) symptoms and conditions are similar to dhatus. The International Classification of diseases ICD-10 classifies Dhat syndrome as both a neurotic disorder (code F48. 8) and a culture-specific disorder (Annexe 2) caused by \"undue concern about the debilitating effects of the passage of semen\". Some doctors believe dhat syndrome to be either a culture-bound presentation of clinical depression, as a somatized set of symptoms, or a result of Western doctors' misinterpretation of patients' descriptions of their condition. It is very common in Nepali culture as well. Most of them come with the complaints of \"drops\" and become extremely anxious about it and see it as loss of \"male power\". It is often related with obsessive ruminations and somatoform symptoms. Others see it as a distinct clinical entity which is less culture-bound than these critics assert, and describe it as one form of a syndrome of \"semen-loss anxiety\" which also occurs in other Eastern cultures as jiryan and shen-k'uei, as well as in Western cultures. Chlamydia infection might also be related to it because of similar symptoms in case of infection of the urethra (urethritis), which is usually symptomatic, causing a white discharge from the penis with or without pain on urinating (dysuria)."}

The most confirmatory investigation is endoscopy of upper gastrointestinal tract. Laboratory - Individuals with gastric outlet obstruction are often hypochloremic, hypokalemic, and alkalotic due to loss of hydrogen chloride and potassium.

It may affect any part of the skeleton, but the most common sites of disease are the shoulder, skull, pelvic girdle, jaw, ribs, and spine. In some cases there are no symptoms until a fracture occurs either spontaneously or following minor trauma, such as a fall. There may be an acute onset of localized pain and swelling. More commonly there is pain of no apparent cause that increases in frequency and intensity over time and may eventually be accompanied by weakness and noticeable deformity of the area. The rate of progression is unpredictable and the prognosis can be difficult. The disease may stabilize after a number of years, go into spontaneous remission, or, in cases involving the chest and upper spine, prove fatal. Recurrence of the disease following remission can also occur. Involvement of the spine and skull base may cause a poor outcome from neurological complications. In many cases, the end result of Gorham's disease is severe deformity and functional disability. Symptoms such as difficulty breathing and chest pain may be present if the disease is present in the ribs, scapula, or thoracic vertebrae. These may indicate that the disease has spread from the bone into the chest cavity. The breathing problems may be misdiagnosed as asthma, because the damage done to the lungs can cause the same types of changes to lung function testing that are seen in asthma. Extension of the lesions into the chest may lead to the development of chylous pleural and pericardial effusions. Chyle is rich in protein and white blood cells that are important in fighting infection. The loss of chyle into the chest can have serious consequences, including infection, malnutrition, and respiratory distress and failure. These complications or their symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, poor growth or weight loss, and infection have sometimes been the first indications of the condition. To date, the specific cause of Gorham's disease remains unknown. Bone mass and strength are obtained and maintained through a process of bone destruction and replacement that occurs at the cellular level throughout a person's life. Cells called osteoclasts secrete enzymes that dissolve old bone, allowing another type of cells called osteoblasts to form new bone."}

Progressive degeneration of the electrical conduction system of the heart can lead to third-degree heart block. This may be preceded by first-degree AV block, second-degree AV block, bundle branch block, or bifascicular block. In addition, acute myocardial infarction may present with third-degree AV block. An inferior wall myocardial infarction may cause damage to the AV node, causing third-degree heart block. In this case, the damage is usually transitory. Studies have shown that third-degree heart block in the setting of an inferior wall myocardial infarction typically resolves within 2 weeks. The escape rhythm typically originates in the AV junction, producing a narrow complex escape rhythm. An anterior wall myocardial infarction may damage the distal conduction system of the heart, causing third-degree heart block. This is typically extensive, permanent damage to the conduction system, necessitating a permanent pacemaker to be placed. The escape rhythm typically originates in the ventricles, producing a wide complex escape rhythm. Third-degree heart block may also be congenital and has been linked to the presence of lupus in the mother. It is thought that maternal antibodies may cross the placenta and attack the heart tissue during gestation. The cause of congenital third-degree heart block in many patients is unknown. Studies suggest that the prevalence of congenital third-degree heart block is between 1 in 15,000 and 1 in 22,000 live births. Hyperkalemia in those with previous cardiac disease and Lyme disease can also result in third-degree heart block. The prognosis of patients with complete heart block is generally poor without therapy. Patients with 1st and 2nd degree heart block are usually asymptomatic.

Nodule formation can also occur when the abnormal corneal endothelium causes contractions around the iris stroma [1]. Herpesvirus DNA has been identified in some patients following keratoplasty, suggesting the possibility that herpes simplex virus may induce the abnormal endotheliazation in the anterior chamber angle and on the surface of the iris [2,3,5].

They will complain to a sleep clinician of early morning insomnia and falling asleep early in the evening. When someone has advanced sleep phase disorder their melatonin levels and core body temperature will cycle hours earlier than an average person. These symptoms must be present for at least three months in order to be correctly diagnosed. ASPD is a rare disorder. It affects both men and women equally and has been determined to have a strong genetic, link with 40\u201350% of sufferers having relatives with the disorder. As stated below, several genes have been discovered to have links with this syndrome and the body's circadian rhythms. Although it can be impairing, the syndrome is not necessarily unhealthy; most people don't seek help unless it starts to severely impact their social life. Once diagnosed, ASPD can be treated with bright light therapy in the evenings or behaviorally with chronotherapy. Unlike other sleep disorders, ASPD does not disrupt normal functioning at work during the day and the patient does not complain of excessive daytime sleepiness. If their ASPD is causing people to lose out on evening activities, including putting their own typical children to bed, they may be able to force themselves to stay up later than their circadian rhythm requires. A sufferer of ASPD will still wake up very early and if this cycle continues it can lead to chronic sleep deprivation and other sleep disorders.

Most of these individuals showed either a deletion or an insertion resulting in a frameshift mutation. Type II and III patients showed small scale changes in the overall structure of D-BP[6]. Amino acid changes in the catalytic domains or those in contact with substrate or cofactors were the main cause of these variations of D-BP deficiency. Other amino acid changes were seen to alter the dimerization of the protein, leading to improper folding. Many mutations have been found in the gene coding for D-BP(HSD17B4)on the q arm two of chromosome five (5q2) in Homo sapiens, most notably individuals homozygous for a missense mutation (616S). The D-bifunctional protein is composed of three enzymatic domains: the N-terminal short chain alcohol dehydrogenase reductase (SDR), central hydratase domain, and the C-terminal sterol carrier protein 2 (SDR). The DBP protein (79kDa) also known as \u201cmultifunctional protein 2\u201d, \u201cmultifunctional enzyme 2\u201d, or \u201cD-peroxisomal bifunctional enzyme\u201d, catalyzes the second and third steps of peroxisomal \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids and their derivatives. A non-functional D-BP protein results in the abnormal accumulation of long chain fatty acids and bile acid intermediates. The D-BP protein contains a peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1) unit at the C-terminus allowing for its transport into peroxisomes by the PTS1 receptor. Inside the peroxisomes, the D-BP protein is partially cleaved exclusively between the SDR and hydratase domains. DBP is a stereospecific enzyme; hydratase domain forms only (R)-hydroxy-acyl-CoA intermediates from trans-2-enoyl-CoAs. D-BP is expressed throughout the entire human body, with the highest mRNA levels in the liver and brain. The hydrogenase and hydratase units of DBP exist as dimers, necessary for correct folding and therefore function of the enzyme. The D-BP gene (HSD17B4), found on the long arm of chromosome 5, consists of 24 exons and 23 introns and is over 100kb in size. Exons 1-12 code for the SDR domain, 12-21 for the hydratase domain, and 21-24 for the SCP2 domain. Transcription is regulated at 400 basepairs upstream of the transcription start site. The missense mutation G16S is the most common mutation that leads to D-BP deficiency. In a 2006 study in which 110 patients were tested, 28 suffered from this frameshift mutation. The second most frequent mutation was the missense mutation N457Y which was seen in 13 of the 110 patients."}

The description is usually of deep, constant, and poorly localized pain out of proportion with the findings on physical examination (often incorrectly described as pain out of proportion to the injury). The pain is aggravated by passively stretching the muscle group within the compartment or actively flexing it (though this finding is not specific to compartment syndrome alone) and is not relieved by analgesia up to and including morphine. - Paresthesia (altered sensation e. g. , \"pins & needles\") in the cutaneous nerves of the affected compartment is another typical sign. - Paralysis of the limb is usually a late finding. The compartment may also feel very tense and firm (pressure). Some find that their feet and even legs fall asleep. This is because compartment syndrome prevents adequate blood flow to the rest of the leg. - A lack of pulse rarely occurs in patients, as pressures that cause compartment syndrome are often well below arterial pressures and pulse is only affected if the relevant artery is contained within the affected compartment. - Tense and swollen shiny skin, sometimes with obvious bruising of the skin. - Congestion of the digits with prolonged capillary refill time.

Sexual arousal disorders were previously known as frigidity in women and impotence in men, though these have now been replaced with less judgmental terms. Impotence is now known as erectile dysfunction, and frigidity has been replaced with a number of terms describing specific problems that can be broken down into four categories as described by the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: lack of desire, lack of arousal, pain during intercourse, and lack of orgasm. For both men and women, these conditions can manifest themselves as an aversion to, and avoidance of, sexual contact with a partner.

The pseudobulbar crying could also be induced by stimulation in the region of the subthalamic nucleus of the brain. Signs and symptoms of pseudobulbar palsy include: - Slow and indistinct speech - Dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing) - Small, stiff and spastic tongue - Brisk jaw jerk - Dysarthria - Labile affect - Gag reflex may be normal, exaggerated or absent - Examination may reveal upper motor neuron lesion of the limbs Diagnosis of pseudobulbar palsy is based on observation of the symptoms of the condition. Tests examining jaw jerk and gag reflex can also be performed. It has been suggested that the majority of patients with pathological laughter and crying have pseudobulbar palsy due to bilateral corticobulbar lesions and often a bipyrimidal involvement of arms and legs. To further confirm the condition, MRI can be performed to define the areas of brain abnormality. Since pseudobulbar palsy is a syndrome associated with other diseases, treating the underlying disease may eventually reduce the symptoms of pseudobulbar palsy. Possible pharmacological interventions for pseudobulbar affect include the tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and a novel approach utilizing dextromethorphan and quinidine sulfate. Nuedexta is an FDA approved medication for pseudobulbar affect. Dextromethorphan, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, inhibits glutamatergic transmission in the regions of the brainstem and cerebellum, which are hypothesized to be involved in pseudobulbar symptoms, and acts as a sigma ligand, binding to the sigma-1 receptors that mediate the emotional motor expression."}

In 1989, Bruce McIntosh coined the term the \"spoiled child syndrome\". The syndrome is characterized by \"excessive, self-centered, and immature behavior\". It includes lack of consideration for other people, recurrent temper tantrums, an inability to handle the delay of gratification, demands for having one's own way, obstructiveness, and manipulation to get their way. McIntosh attributed the syndrome to \"the failure of parents to enforce consistent, age-appropriate limits\", but others, such as Aylward, note that temperament is probably a contributory factor. It is important to note that the temper tantrums are recurrent. McIntosh observes that \"many of the problem behaviors that cause parental concern are unrelated to spoiling as properly understood\". Children may have occasional temper tantrums without them falling under the umbrella of \"spoiled\". Extreme cases of spoiled child syndrome, in contrast, will involve frequent temper tantrums, physical aggression, defiance, destructive behavior, and refusal to comply with even the simple demands of daily tasks. This can be similar to the profile of children diagnosed with Pathological Demand Avoidance, which is part of the autism spectrum. Children with underlying medical or mental health problems may exhibit some of the symptoms. Indeed, where the difficulties are not predicated in the parental-child nexus, many loving parents may be judged as \"spoiling\" instead of affirmed. Speech or hearing disorders, and attention deficit disorder, may lead to children's failing to understand the limits set by parents. Children who have recently experienced a stressful event, such as the separation of the parents (divorce) or the birth or death of a close family relative, may also exhibit some or all of the symptoms. Children of parents who themselves have psychiatric disorders may manifest some of the symptoms, because the parents behave erratically, sometimes failing to perceive their children's behavior correctly, and thus fail to properly or consistently define limits of normal behavior for them. Parents can seek advice, support, and encouragement to empower them in parenthood from diverse sources. Treatment by a physician involves assessing parental competence, and whether the parents set limits correctly and consistently. Physicians should rule out dysfunction in the family, referring dysfunctional families for family therapy and dysfunctional parents for parenting skills training, and counsel parents in methods for modifying their child's behavior. In early infancy, a baby seeks food, contact, and comfort by crying. This behavior should be viewed as a distress signal indicating that some biological need is not being met."}

Prolapse was also known. The theory of a wandering uterus was developed in Ancient Greece, being mentioned in many sections of the Hippocratic treatise \"Diseases of Women\". Plato talks of the uterus as a separate being inside women, while Aretaeus described it as \"an animal within an animal\" (less emotively, \"a living thing inside a living thing\"), which causes symptoms by wandering around a woman's body putting pressure on other organs. The standard cure for this \"hysterical suffocation\" was scent therapy, in which good smells were placed under a woman's genitals and bad odors at the nose, while sneezing could be also induced to drive the uterus back to its correct place. While in the Hippocratic texts a wide range of women were susceptible - including in particular the childless - Galen in the 2nd century omitted the childless and saw the most vulnerable group as \"widows, and particularly those who previously menstruated regularly, had been pregnant and were eager to have intercourse, but were now deprived of all this\" (On the Affected Parts, 6. 5). He also denied that the womb could \"move from one place to another like a wandering animal\". His treatments included scent therapy and sexual intercourse, but also rubbing in ointments to the external genitalia; this was to be performed by midwives, not physicians. While most Hippocratic writers saw the retention of menstrual blood in the womb as a key problem, for Galen even more serious was the retention of \"female seed\". In Medieval times, this idea of the \u201cwandering uterus\u201d persisted, as did the methods of treatment. There was also the idea that there was a build up of humours, or fluid in the uterus that needed to be purged in order to cure the female patient of the disease. Self-treatment such as masturbation, was not recommended and also considered taboo. Marriage, and therefore regular sexual intercourse was considered the best long-term treatment option. There was continued debate about whether it was morally acceptable for a physician to remove excess female seed through genital manipulation of the female patient; Pieter van Foreest (Forestus) and Giovanni Matteo da Grado (Gradus) insisted on using midwives as intermediaries, and regarded the treatment as the last resort. Through the Middle Ages another cause of dramatic symptoms could be found: possession. It was thought that demoniacal forces were attracted to those who were prone to melancholy, particularly single women and the elderly. When a patient could not be diagnosed, or cured of a disease, it was thought that the symptoms, of what we now know as mental illness, were actually those of someone possessed by the devil. In the 16th and 17th centuries, hysteria was still believed to be due to retention of fluids in the uterus, sexual deprivation, or by the tendency of the uterus to wander around the female body causing irritability and suffocation. Marriage, and regular sexual encounters with her husband, was still the most highly recommended course of treatment for a woman suffering from hysteria."}

When 7q is altered by a deletion or a translocation ectrodactyly can sometimes be associated with hearing loss. Ectrodactyly, or Split hand/split foot malformation (SHFM) type 1 is the only form of split hand/ malformation associated with sensorineural hearing loss. A large number of human gene defects can cause ectrodactyly. The most common mode of inheritance is autosomal dominant with reduced penetrance, while autosomal recessive and X-linked forms occur more rarely. Ectrodactyly can also be caused by a duplication on 10q24. Detailed studies of a number of mouse models for ectrodactyly have also revealed that a failure to maintain median apical ectodermal ridge (AER) signalling can be the main pathogenic mechanism in triggering this abnormality. A number of factors make the identification of the genetic defects underlying human ectrodactyly a complicated process: the limited number of families linked to each split hand/foot malformation (SHFM) locus, the large number of morphogens involved in limb development, the complex interactions between these morphogens, the involvement of modifier genes, and the presumed involvement of multiple gene or long-range regulatory elements in some cases of ectrodactyly. In the clinical setting these genetic characteristics can become problematic and making predictions of carrier status and severity of the disease impossible to predict. In 2011, a novel mutation in DLX5 was found to be involved in SHFM. Ectrodactyly is frequently seen with other congenital anomalies. Syndromes in which ectrodactyly is associated with other abnormalities can occur when two or more genes are affected by a chromosomal rearrangement. Disorders associated with ectrodactyly include Ectrodactyly-Ectodermal Dysplasia-Clefting (EEC) syndrome, which is closely correlated to the ADULT syndrome and Limb-mammary (LMS) syndrome, Ectrodactyly-Cleft Palate (ECP) syndrome, Ectrodactyly-Ectodermal Dysplasia-Macular Dystrophy syndrome, Ectrodactyly-Fibular Aplasia/Hypoplasia (EFA) syndrome, and Ectrodactyly-Polydactyly. More than 50 syndromes and associations involving ectrodactyly are distinguished in the London Dysmorphology Database. The pathophysiology of cleft hand is thought to be a result of a wedge-shaped defect of the apical ectoderm of the limb bud (AER: apical ectodermal ridge). Polydactyly, syndactyly and cleft hand can occur within the same hand, therefore some investigators suggest that these entities occur from the same mechanism. This mechanism is not yet defined. The cause of cleft hand lies, for what is known, partly in genetics. The inheritance of cleft hand is autosomal dominant and has a variable penetrance of 70%. Cleft hand can be a spontaneous mutation during pregnancy (de novo mutation)."}

Additionally, the WHO scheme recognizes mixed tumors with both neuroendocrine and epithelial carcinoma features, such as goblet cell cancer, a rare gastrointestinal tract tumor. Placing a given tumor into one of categories depends on well-defined histological features: size, lymphovascular invasion, mitotic counts, Ki-67 labelling index, invasion of adjacent organs, presence of metastases and whether they produce hormones. Traditionally, neuroendocrine tumors have been classified by their anatomic site of origin. NETs can arise in many different areas of the body, and are most often located in the intestine, pancreas or the lungs. The various kinds of cells that can give rise to NETs are present in endocrine glands and are also diffusely distributed throughout the body, most commonly Kulchitsky cells or similar enterochromaffin-like cells, that are relatively more common in the gastrointestinal and pulmonary systems. NETs include certain tumors of the gastrointestinal tract and of the pancreatic islet cells, certain thymus and lung tumors, and medullary carcinoma of the parafollicular cells of the thyroid. Tumors with similar cellular characteristics in the pituitary, parathyroid, and adrenomedullary glands are sometimes included or excluded. Within the broad category of neuroendocrine tumors there are many different tumor types: this outline is presented to facilitate retrieving information. Neuroendocrine tumors are uncommon in many of these areas, and frequently represent only a very small proportion of the tumors or cancers at these locations. - Pituitary gland: Neuroendocrine tumor of the anterior pituitary - Thyroid gland: Neuroendocrine thyroid tumors, particularly medullary carcinoma - Parathyroid tumors - Thymus and mediastinal carcinoid tumors - Pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors - bronchus - pulmonary carcinoid tumors: typical carcinoid (TC; low-grade); atypical carcinoid (AC; intermediate-grade) - small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) - large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung (LCNEC) - Extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas (ESCC or EPSCC) - Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NET) - Foregut GEP-NET (foregut tumors can conceptually encompasses not only NETs of the stomach and proximal duodenum, but also the pancreas, and even thymus, lung and bronchus) - Pancreatic endocrine tumors (if considered separately from foregut GEP-NET) - Midgut GEP-NET (from distal half of 2nd part of the duodenum to the proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon) - appendix, including well differentiated NETs (benign); well differentiated NETs (uncertain malignant potential); well differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma (with low malignant potential); mixed exocrine-neuroendocrine carcinoma (goblet cell carcinoma, also called adenocarcinoid and mucous adenocarcinoid) - Hindgut GEP-NET - Liver and gallbladder - Adrenal tumors, particularly adrenomedullary tumors - Pheochromocytoma - Peripheral nervous system tumors, such as: - Schwannoma - paraganglioma - neuroblastoma - Breast - Genitourinary tract - urinary tract carcinoid tumor and neuroendocrine carcinoma - ovary - neuroendocrine tumor of the cervix - testes - Merkel cell carcinoma of skin (trabecular cancer) - Several inherited conditions: - multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) - multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) - von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease - neurofibromatosis type 1 - tuberous sclerosis - Carney complex Neuroendocrine lesions are graded histologically according to markers of cellular proliferation, rather than cellular polymorphism. The following grading scheme is currently recommended for all gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms by the World Health Organisation: If mitotic count and ki67 are discordant, the figure which gives the highest grade is used. G1 and G2 neuroendocrine neoplasms are called neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) - formerly called carcinoid tumours. G3 neoplasms are called neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs). It has been proposed that the current G3 category be further separated into histologically well-differentiated and poorly-differentiated neoplasms to better reflect prognosis. Currently there is no one staging system for all neuroendocrine neoplasms. Well differentiated lesions generally have their own staging system based on anatomical location, whereas poorly differentiated and mixed lesions are staged as carcinomas of that location. For example, gastric NEC and mixed adenoneuroendocrine cancers are staged as a primary carcinoma of the stomach. TNM staging of gastroenteropancreatic Grade 1 and Grade 2 neuroendocrine tumors is as follows: Most pancreatic NETs are sporadic. However, neuroendocrine tumors can be seen in several inherited familial syndromes, including: - multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) - multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) - von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease - neurofibromatosis type 1 - tuberous sclerosis - Carney complex Given these associations, recommendations in NET include family history evaluation, evaluation for second tumors, and in selected circumstances testing for germline mutations such as for MEN1."}

The term \"physiologic leukorrhea\" is used to refer to leukorrhea due to estrogen stimulation. Leukorrhea may occur normally during pregnancy. This is caused by increased bloodflow to the vagina due to increased estrogen. Female infants may have leukorrhea for a short time after birth due to their in-uterine exposure to estrogen. It may also result from inflammation or congestion of the vaginal mucosa. In cases where it is yellowish or gives off an odor, a doctor should be consulted since it could be a sign of several disease processes, including an organic bacterial infection (aerobic vaginitis) or STD. After delivery, leukorrhea accompanied by backache and foul-smelling lochia (post-partum vaginal discharge, containing blood, mucus, and placental tissue) may suggest the failure of involution (the uterus returning to pre-pregnancy size) due to infection. A number of investigation such as wet smear, Gram stain, culture, pap smear and biopsy are suggested to diagnose the condition. Leukorrhea is also caused by trichomonads, a group of parasitic protozoan, specifically Trichomonas vaginalis. Common symptoms of this disease are burning sensation, itching and discharge of frothy substance, thick, white or yellow mucous. Leukorrhea may be caused by sexually transmitted diseases; therefore, treating the STD will help treat the leukorrhea. Treatment may include antibiotics, such as metronidazole.

In 1959, to bolster dwindling stocks of native crayfish, the signal crayfish was introduced to Sweden. The signal crayfish was known to be resistant, and it was not recognised at that time that it was a carrier of the disease. After 150 years of contact, no resistance has been discovered in native European crayfish. This species was studied and named by the German Mycologist, Friedrich Schikora (1859\u20131932), from a type specimen in Germany in 1906. Implantations of the signal crayfish were the reason for the spread of the disease to United Kingdom and Ireland. Transport of signal crayfish, red swamp crayfish and infected native European freshwater crayfish between waters is the main cause for contamination. Transmission of the disease through items that has been in contact with contaminated water, for example a fishing tool or footwear is also possible. The spores are also sensitive to high or low temperatures. Most authorities have local rules and regulations that the amount of water moved between different waters (in for example a boat) is minimised. It is usually also recommended to only use fishing bait from the same lake when fishing, alternatively freeze it to at least for one day before use, if risk for contamination exists. The spores of crayfish plague disappear from an infected water system (connected lakes and rivers) in a few weeks after the last infected crayfish is gone. Reintroduction is then possible, as long as no infected waters are in contact with the lake. Infection with Aphanomyces astaci is accompanied by few signs in its early stages, and the first indication of infection may be mortality. In the later stages, the muscles of the tail may appear whitened, or brownish-red where blood cells have encapsulated the hyphae. The effects of the neurotoxins in the oomycete can include appearing in daytime (crayfish are typically nocturnal) and a lack of coordination."}

The prevalence of cryptococcosis has been increasing over the past 20 years for many reasons, including the increase in incidence of AIDS and the expanded use of immunosuppressive drugs. In humans, C. neoformans causes three types of infections: - Wound or cutaneous cryptococcosis - Pulmonary cryptococcosis - Cryptococcal meningitis. Cryptococcal meningitis (infection of the meninges, the tissue covering the brain) is believed to result from dissemination of the fungus from either an observed or unappreciated pulmonary infection. Often there is also silent dissemination throughout the brain when meningitis is present. Cryptococcus gattii causes infections in immunocompetent people (fully functioning immune system), but C. neoformans v. grubii, and v. neoformans usually only cause clinically evident infections in persons with some form of defect in their immune systems (immunocompromised persons).

Other terms used to describe the condition in dogs include cerebellar cortical atrophy and postnatal cerebellar cortical degeneration. Cerebellar abiotrophy in horses was originally thought to be a form of cerebellar hypoplasia and was described as such in older research literature. However, it was discovered that in horses, the die-off of purkinje cells began after the animal was born, rather than occurring in utero. Cerebellar hypoplasia is particularly common in cats and has similar symptoms. There are other diseases that lead to cerebellar degeneration, but the loss of Purkinje cells is a clear way to diagnose CA, and the combination of symptoms is sufficiently unique that CA can easily be distinguished from other conditions, even in a living animal. Symptoms of cerebellar abiotrophy include ataxia or lack of balance, an awkward wide-legged stance, a head tremor (intention tremor) (in dogs, body tremors also occur), hyperreactivity, lack of menace reflex, stiff or high-stepping gait, coarse or jerky head bob when in motion (or in very young animals, when attempting to nurse), apparent lack of awareness of where the feet are (sometimes standing or trying to walk with a foot knuckled over), poor depth perception, and a general inability to determine space and distance. The symptoms, when taken as a group, are distinctive and not easily mimicked by other illnesses, though certain types of neurological injury and infection need to be ruled out. Verifying the diagnosis in a laboratory setting is possible only by examining the brain post-mortem to determine if there has been a loss of Purkinje cells. Most affected animals have normal intelligence and mildly affected animals can, in theory, live out a normal lifespan. However, affected animals are quite accident-prone, and for this reason many animals that develop CA, particularly horses, are euthanized for humane reasons. Horses may experience difficulty stepping up and over objects, run into fences, fall easily, and even if allowed to mature to full growth, are generally considered unsafe to ride. Dogs may need lifetime assistance with tasks such as climbing stairs. In horses, the symptoms may worsen from the time of onset for six to 12 months, but if not severe enough to mandate euthansia, they stabilize over time. In some dog breeds, symptoms appear to progressively worsen, but research is not consistent on this point. There also is some evidence that affected animals partially compensate for the condition by cognitively learning alternative methods for moving or to determine distance, and thus appear to improve because they become less accident-prone. Cerebellar abiotrophy (CA) is best known as a condition affecting Arabian horses. It has also been observed in the Curly horse, Miniature horse, the Gotland Pony, one Eriskay Pony, and possibly the Oldenburg. Most foals appear normal at birth, with symptoms noticeable at an average age of four months, though there have been cases where the condition is first seen shortly after birth and other cases where symptoms are first recognized in horses over one year of age.

Inflammation has many possible causes, including irritation by environmental substances, physical trauma, and infection such as bacterial, viral, or fungal. Some of these infections are sexually transmitted diseases. It is less common among people who are circumcised as in many cases the foreskin contributes to the disease. Both not enough cleaning and too much cleaning can cause problems. Diabetes can make balanitis more likely, especially if the blood sugar is poorly controlled. It is important to exclude other causes of similar symptoms such as penile cancer. Diagnosis may include careful identification of the cause with the aid of a good patient history, swabs and cultures, and pathological examination of a biopsy. Initial treatment in adults often involves simply pulling back the foreskin and cleaning the penis. Balanitis \"is a common condition affecting 11% of adult men seen in urology clinics and 3% of children\" in the United States; globally, balanitis \"may occur in up to 3% of uncircumcised males\". In dogs, balanoposthitis is caused by a disruption in the integumentary system, such as a wound or intrusion of a foreign body. A dog with this condition behaves normally, with the exception of excessive licking at the prepuce, and a yellow green, pus-like discharge is usually present. In sheep (rams/wethers), ulcerative enzootic balanoposthitis is caused by the Corynebacterium renale group (C. renale, C. pilosum & C. cystidis). For the condition in bulls, caused by a virus see Bovine herpesvirus 1. Balanoposthitis is believed to have contributed to the decline to near-extinction of Gilbert's potoroo."}

The most probable explanation for blackwater fever is an autoimmune reaction apparently caused by the interaction of the malaria parasite and the use of quinine. Blackwater fever is caused by heavy parasitization of red blood cells with Plasmodium falciparum. There has been at least one case, however, attributed to Plasmodium vivax. Blackwater fever is a serious complication of malaria, but cerebral malaria has a higher mortality rate. Blackwater fever is much less common today than it was before 1950. It may be that quinine plays a role in triggering the condition, and this drug is no longer commonly used for malaria prophylaxis. Quinine remains important for treatment of malaria. The treatment is antimalarial chemotherapy, intravenous fluid and sometimes supportive care such as intensive care and dialysis."}

Most sources define exophthalmos/proptosis as a protrusion of the globe greater than 18 mm. The term exophthalmos is often used when describing proptosis associated with Graves' disease. Proptosis is the anterior displacement of the eye from the orbit. Since the orbit is closed off posteriorly, medially and laterally, any enlargement of structures located within will cause the anterior displacement of the eye. Swelling or enlargement of the lacrimal gland causes inferior medial and anterior dislocation of the eye. This is because the lacrimal glands are located superiorly and laterally in the orbit.

It is seen in brachycephalic (short-nosed) dog breeds because of the shallow orbit. However, it can lead to keratitis secondary to exposure of the cornea. Exophthalmos is commonly seen in the Pug, Boston Terrier, Pekingese, and Shih Tzu. It is a common result of head trauma and pressure exerted on the front of the neck too hard in dogs.

Heavy infections can lead to the development of iron deficiency and hypochromic microcytic anemia. This form of anemia in children can give rise to physical and mental retardation. Infection caused by cutaneous larvae migrans, a skin disease in humans, is characterized by skin ruptures and severe itching. Necatoriasis is caused by N. americanus. N. americanus can be divided into two areas \u2013 larvae and adult stage. The third stage larvae are guided to human skin by following thermal gradients. Typically, the larvae enter through the hands and feet following contact with contaminated soil. A papular, pruritic, itchy rash will develop around the site of entry into the human host. This is also known as \"ground itch\". Generally, migration through the lungs is asymptomatic but a mild cough and pharyngeal irritation may occur during larval migration in the airways. Once larvae break through the alveoli and are swallowed, they enter the gastrointestinal tract and attach to the intestinal mucosa where they mature into adult worms. The hookworms attach to the mucosal lining using their cutting plates which allows them to penetrate blood vessels and feed on the host's blood supply. Each worm consumes 30\u03bcl of blood per day. The major issue results from this intestinal blood loss which can lead to iron-deficiency anemia in moderate to heavy infections.

The patient may also experience added respiratory sounds which in the more severe cases can be identified as stridor but in many cases can be readily mistaken for wheeze. This creates a diagnostic pitfall in which many patients with laryngotracheal stenosis are incorrectly diagnosed as having asthma and are treated for presumed lower airway disease. This increases the likelihood of the patient eventually requiring major open surgery in benign disease and can lead to tracheal cancer presenting too late for curative surgery to be performed. Laryngotracheal stenosis is an umbrella term for a wide and heterogeneous group of very rare conditions. The population incidence of adult post-intubation laryngotracheal stenosis which is the commonest benign sub-type of this condition is approximately 1 in 200,000 adults per year. The main causes of adult laryngotracheal stenosis are: The optimal management of laryngotracheal stenosis is not well defined, depending mainly on the type of the stenosis. General treatment options include 1. Tracheal dilation using rigid bronchoscope 2. Laser surgery and endoluminal stenting 3. Tracheal resection and laryngotracheal reconstructionr Tracheal dilation is used to temporarily enlarge the airway. The effect of dilation typically lasts from a few days to 6 months. Several studies have shown that as a result of mechanical dilation (used alone) may occur a high mortality rate and a rate of recurrence of stenosis higher than 90%. Thus, many authors treat the stenosis by endoscopic excision with laser (commonly either the carbon dioxide or the neodymium: yttrium aluminum garnet laser) and then by using bronchoscopic dilatation and prolonged stenting with a T-tube (generally in silicone). There are differing opinions on treating with laser surgery. In very experienced surgery centers, tracheal resection and reconstruction (anastomosis complete end-to-end with or without laryngotracheal temporary stent to prevent airway collapse) is currently the best alternative to completely cure the stenosis and allows to obtain good results. Therefore, it can be considered the gold standard treatment and is suitable for almost all patients. The narrowed part of the trachea will be cut off and the cut ends of the trachea sewn together with sutures. For stenosis of length greater than 5 cm a stent may be required to join the sections. Late June or early July 2010, a new potential treatment was trialed at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, where Ciaran Finn-Lynch (aged 11) received a transplanted trachea which had been injected with stem cells harvested from his own bone marrow."}

Fecal occult blood testing is positive when bleeding is active. If bleeding is intermittent the test may be negative at times. Histologically, it resembles telangiectasia and development is related to age and strain on the bowel wall. It is a degenerative lesion, acquired, probably resulting from chronic and intermittent contraction of the colon that is obstructing the venous drainage of the mucosa. As time goes by the veins become more and more tortuous, while the capillaries of the mucosa gradually dilate and precapillary sphincter becomes incompetent. Thus is formed an arteriovenous malformation characterized by a small tuft of dilated vessels. Although angiodysplasia is probably quite common, the risk of bleeding is increased in disorders of coagulation. A classic association is Heyde's syndrome (coincidence of aortic valve stenosis and bleeding from angiodysplasia). In this disorder, von Willebrand factor (vWF) is proteolysed due to high shear stress in the highly turbulent blood flow around the aortic valve. vWF is most active in vascular beds with high shear stress, including angiodysplasias, and deficiency of vWF increases the bleeding risk from such lesions. Warkentin et al. argue that apart from aortic valve stenosis, some other conditions that feature high shear stress might also increase the risk of bleeding from angiodysplasia. Diagnosis of angiodysplasia is often accomplished with endoscopy, either colonoscopy or esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Although the lesions can be notoriously hard to find, the patient usually is diagnosed by endoscopy. A new technique, pill enteroscopy, has been a major advance in diagnosis, especially in the small bowel which is difficult to reach with traditional endoscopy. With this technique a pill that contains a video camera and radio transmitter is swallowed, and pictures of the small intestine are sent to a receiver worn by the patient. Recently, multiphase CT angiography (without positive oral contrast) has been shown to play a promising role in the diagnoses of small and large bowel angiodysplasia, especially when associated with active hemorrhage Angiodysplasiae in the small bowel can also be diagnosed and treated with double-balloon enteroscopy, a technique involving a long endoscopic camera and overtube, both fitted with balloons, that allow the bowel to be accordioned over the camera. In cases with negative endoscopic findings and high clinical suspicion, selective angiography of the mesenteric arteries is sometimes necessary, but this allows for interventions at time of the procedure. An alternative is scintigraphy with red blood cells labeled with a radioactive marker; this shows the site of the bleeding on a gamma camera but tends to be unhelpful unless the bleeding is continuous and significant."}

Chondromalacia patellae is a term sometimes treated synonymously with PFPS. However, there is general consensus that PFPS applies only to individuals without cartilage damage, thereby distinguishing it from chondromalacia patellae, a condition characterized by softening of the patellar articular cartilage. Despite this academic distinction, the diagnosis of PFPS is typically made clinically, based only on the history and physical examination rather than on the results of any medical imaging. Therefore, it is unknown whether most persons with a diagnosis of PFPS have cartilage damage or not, making the difference between PFPS and chondromalacia theoretical rather than practical. It is thought that only some individuals with anterior knee pain will have true chondromalacia patellae. The onset of the condition is usually gradual, although some cases may appear suddenly following trauma. - Knee pain - the most common symptom is diffuse peripatellar pain (vague pain around the kneecap) and localized retropatellar pain (pain focused behind the kneecap). Affected individuals typically have difficulty describing the location of the pain, and may place their hands over the anterior patella or describe a circle around the patella (the \"circle sign\"). Pain is usually initiated when load is put on the knee extensor mechanism, e. g. ascending or descending stairs or slopes, squatting, kneeling, cycling, running or prolonged sitting with flexed (bent) knees. The latter feature is sometimes termed the \"movie sign\" or \"theatre sign\" because individuals might experience pain while sitting to watch a film or similar activity. The pain is typically aching with occasional sharp pains. - Crepitus (joint noises) may be present - Giving-way of the knee may be reported In most patients with PFPS an examination of their history will highlight a precipitating event that caused the injury. Changes in activity patterns such as excessive increases in running mileage, repetitions such as running up steps and the addition of strength exercises that affect the patellofemoral joint are commonly associated with symptom onset. Excessively worn or poorly fitted footwear may be a contributing factor. To prevent recurrence the causal behaviour should be identified and managed correctly. The medical cause of PFPS is thought to be increased pressure on the patellofemoral joint. There are several theorized mechanisms relating to how this increased pressure occurs: - Increased levels of physical activity - Malalignment of the patella as it moves through the femoral groove - Quadriceps muscle imbalance - Tight anatomical structures, e."}

The ostium secundum atrial septal defect is the most common type of atrial septal defect, and comprises 6\u201310% of all congenital heart diseases. The secundum atrial septal defect usually arises from an enlarged foramen ovale, inadequate growth of the septum secundum, or excessive absorption of the septum primum. About 10 to 20% of individuals with ostium secundum ASDs also have mitral valve prolapse. An ostium secundum ASD accompanied by an acquired mitral valve stenosis is called Lutembacher's syndrome. Most individuals with an uncorrected secundum ASD do not have significant symptoms through early adulthood. More than 70% develop symptoms by about 40 years of age. Symptoms are typically decreased exercise tolerance, easy fatigability, palpitations, and syncope. Complications of an uncorrected secundum ASD include pulmonary hypertension, right-sided heart failure, atrial fibrillation or flutter, stroke, and Eisenmenger's syndrome. While pulmonary hypertension is unusual before 20 years of age, it is seen in 50% of individuals above the age of 40. Progression to Eisenmenger's syndrome occurs in 5 to 10% of individuals late in the disease process. A patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a small channel that has some hemodynamic consequence; it is a remnant of the fetal foramen ovale, which normally closes at birth. In medical use, the term \"patent\" means open or unobstructed. In about 25% of people, the foramen ovale fails to close properly, leaving them with a PFO or at least with what some physicians classify as a \"pro-PFO\", which is a PFO that is normally closed, but can open under increased blood pressure. On echocardiography, shunting of blood may not be noted except when the patient coughs. Clinically, PFO is linked to stroke, sleep apnea, migraine with aura, and decompression sickness. No cause is established for a foramen ovale to remain open instead of closing naturally, but heredity and genetics may play a role. The mechanism by which a PFO may play a role in stroke is called paradoxical embolism. In the case of PFO, a blood clot from the venous circulatory system is able to pass from the right atrium directly into the left atrium via the PFO, rather than being filtered by the lungs, and thereupon into systemic circulation toward the brain. PFO is common in patients with atrial septal aneurysms (ASA) which are also linked to cryptogenic (i."}

Many FA patients (about 30%) do not have any of the classic physical findings, but Diepoxybutane chromosome fragility assay showing increased chromosomal breaks can make the diagnosis. About 80% of FA will develop bone marrow failure by age 20. The first sign of a hematologic problem is usually petechiae and bruises, with later onset of pale appearance, feeling tired, and infections. Because macrocytosis usually precedes a low platelet count, patients with typical congenital anomalies associated with FA should be evaluated for an elevated red blood cell mean corpuscular volume. FA is primarily an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. This means that two mutated alleles (one from each parent) are required to cause the disease. The risk is 25% that each subsequent child will have FA. About 2% of FA cases are X-linked recessive, which means that if the mother carries one mutated Fanconi anemia allele on one X chromosome, a 50% chance exists that male offspring will present with Fanconi anemia.

Specifically, hypomania is distinguished from mania by the absence of psychotic symptoms and grandiosity, and by its lesser degree of impact on functioning. Hypomania is a feature of bipolar II disorder and cyclothymia, but can also occur in schizoaffective disorder. Hypomania is also a feature of bipolar I disorder; it arises in sequential procession as the mood disorder fluctuates between normal mood (euthymia) and mania. Some individuals with bipolar I disorder have hypomanic as well as manic episodes. Hypomania can also occur when moods progress downwards from a manic mood state to a normal mood. Hypomania is sometimes credited with increasing creativity and productive energy. Numerous people with bipolar disorder have credited hypomania with giving them an edge in their theater of work. People who experience hyperthymia, or \"chronic hypomania\", encounter the same symptoms as hypomania but on a longer-term basis. Cyclothymia, a condition of continuous mood fluctuations, is characterized by oscillating experiences of hypomania and depression that fail to meet the diagnostic criteria for either manic or major depressive episodes. These periods are often interspersed with periods of relatively normal (euthymic) functioning. When a patient presents with a history of at least one episode of both hypomania and major depression, each of which meet the diagnostic criteria, bipolar II disorder is diagnosed. In some cases, depressive episodes routinely occur during the fall or winter and hypomanic ones in the spring or summer. In such cases, one speaks of a \"seasonal pattern\". If left untreated, and in those so predisposed, hypomania may transition into mania, which may be psychotic, in which case bipolar I disorder is the correct diagnosis. Mania and hypomania are usually studied together as components of bipolar disorders, and the pathophysiology is usually assumed to be the same. Given that norepinephrine and dopaminergic drugs are capable of triggering hypomania, theories relating to monoamine hyperactivity have been proposed. A theory unifying depression and mania in bipolar individuals proposes that decreased serotonergic regulation of other monoamines can result in either depressive or manic symptoms. Lesions on the right side frontal and temporal lobes have further been associated with mania. Often in those who have experienced their first episode of hypomania \u2013 generally without psychotic features \u2013 there may be a long or recent history of depression or a mix of hypomania combined with depression (known as mixed-state) prior to the emergence of manic symptoms."}

If the tumor involves the head and neck region (in about 35%), then pain, a mass, obstructive symptoms, among others, may be experienced. NUT midline carcinomas are not specific to any tissue type or organ. Common sites include the head, neck and mediastinum. The median age at diagnosis is 17 years, but older patients may be affected. NMC when viewed microscopically, are poorly differentiated carcinomas which show abrupt transitions to islands of well-differentiated squamous epithelium. This tumor pattern is not specific or unique to NUT midline carcinoma, but this pattern is most suggestive of the diagnosis. The neoplastic cells will show a positive reaction with various cytokeratins, p63, CEA, and CD34 immunohistochemistry. However, the NUT antibody confirms the diagnosis (although only available in a limited number of laboratories). The differential diagnosis is quite wide, but it is important to consider this tumor type when seeing a poorly differentiated tumor that shows abrupt areas of keratinization. Other tumors included in the differential diagnosis are sinonasal undifferentiated carcinomas, Ewing sarcoma/Primitive neuroectodermal tumor, leukemia, rhabdomyosarcoma, and melanoma. When NUT midline carcinoma is seen in the head and neck, the squamous lining of the cavities may be entrapped by the neoplastic cells, and so it is important to document the carcinoma cells in the rest of the tumor by a variety of stains (including cytokeratin or p63). One of the most helpful and characteristic findings is the focal abrupt squamous differentiation, where stratification and gradual differentiation are absent, resembling a Hassall corpuscle of the thymus.

Calcium channel blockers, also known as calcium channel antagonists, are widely used for a number of health conditions. Thus they are commonly present in many people's homes. In young children one pill may cause serious health problems and potentially death. The calcium channel blocker that caused the greatest number of deaths in 2010 in the United States was verapamil. This agent is believed to cause more heart problems than many of the others. A blood or urine test to diagnose overdose is not generally available. CCB overdose may cause high blood sugar levels, and this is often a sign of how severe the problem will become. CCB toxicity can cause a number of electrocardiogram abnormalities with a low sinus rhythm being the most common. Others include: QT prolongation, bundle branch block, first-degree atrioventricular block, and even sinus tachycardia. It may not be possible to tell the difference between beta blocker toxicity and calcium channel blocker overdose based on signs and symptoms. The medical management of CCB toxicity may be difficult. It may not improve with the usual treatments used for a low blood pressure and a slow heart rate."}

Other seizure types such as generalized tonic-clonic and absence seizures can also occur. Patients often report quick jerking movements in the morning that results in knocking over objects such as their morning orange juice. Clusters of myoclonic seizures can lead to absence seizures, and clusters of absence seizures can lead to generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The onset of symptoms is generally around age 10-16 although some patients can present in their 20s or even early 30s. The myoclonic jerks generally precede the generalized tonic-clonic seizures by several months. Some people with the disorder never get generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCs). Sleep deprivation is a major factor in triggering GTCs. College students often present with a GTC after \"pulling an all-nighter. \" Patients with JME generally do not have other neurological problems. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is an inherited genetic syndrome, but the way in which this disorder is inherited is unclear. Frequently (17-49%) those with JME have relatives with a history of epileptic seizures. It is currently unclear if JME is more common in males or females. Almost all cases of JME, however, have an onset in early childhood to puberty. Diagnosis is typically made based on patient history. The physical examination should be normal. The primary diagnosis for JME is a good knowledge of patient history and the neurologist's familiarity with the myoclonic jerks, which are the hallmark of the syndrome. Additionally, an electroencephalogram (EEG), will indicate a pattern of waves and spikes associated with the syndrome."}

As the urine is more concentrated in the morning, this is when the color is most pronounced. This phenomenon mainly occurs in those who have the primary form of PNH, who will notice this at some point in their disease course. The remainder mainly experience the symptoms of anemia, such as tiredness, shortness of breath, and palpitations. A small proportion of patients report attacks of abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing and pain during swallowing, as well as erectile dysfunction in men; this occurs mainly when the breakdown of red blood cells is rapid, and is attributable to spasm of smooth muscle due to depletion of nitric oxide by red cell breakdown products. Forty percent of people with PNH develop thrombosis (a blood clot) at some point in their illness. This is the main cause of severe complications and death in PNH. These may develop in common sites (deep vein thrombosis of the leg and resultant pulmonary embolism when these clots break off and enter the lungs), but in PNH blood clots may also form in more unusual sites: the hepatic vein (causing Budd-Chiari syndrome), the portal vein of the liver (causing portal vein thrombosis), the superior or inferior mesenteric vein (causing mesenteric ischemia) and veins of the skin. Cerebral venous thrombosis, an uncommon form of stroke, is more common in those with PNH. All cells have proteins attached to their membranes, often serving as a mode of communication or signaling between the cell and the surrounding environment. These signaling proteins are physically attached to the cell membrane in various ways, commonly anchored by glycolipids such as glycosyl phosphatidylinositols (GPI). PNH occurs as a result of a defect in the assembling of these glycolipid-protein structures on the surface of blood cells. The most common defective enzyme in PNH is phosphatidylinositol glycan A (PIGA), one of several enzymes needed to make GPI. The gene that codes for PIGA is located on the X chromosome, which means that only one active copy of the gene for PIGA is present in each cell (initially, females have two copies, but one is silenced through X-inactivation). A mutation in the PIGA gene can lead to the absence of GPI anchors expressed on the cell membrane. When this mutation occurs in a hematopoietic stem cell in the bone marrow, all of the cells it produces will also have the defect. Several of the proteins that anchor to GPI on the cell membrane are used to protect the cell from destruction by the complement system, and, without these anchors, the cells are more easily targeted by the complement proteins. Although red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are targeted by complement, red blood cells are particularly vulnerable to lysis. The complement system is part of the innate immune system and has a variety of functions, from destroying invading microorganisms by opsonization to direct destabilization by the membrane attack complex. The main proteins that protect blood cells from destruction are decay-accelerating factor (DAF/CD55), which disrupts formation of C3-convertase, and protectin (CD59/MIRL/MAC-IP), which binds the membrane attack complex and prevents C9 from binding to the cell."}

However, death rates from papillary cancer remains static from 2003 to 2012 at 0. 5 per 100,000 men and women. There was an increased incidence of papillary cancer from 1910 to 1960 due to the use of ioninsing radiation in treating childhood head and neck cancers. The incidence decreased after radiation therapy was abondoned. Environmental exposures to radiation such as atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Chernobyl disaster also causes an increase in childhood papillary thyroid cancer at 5 to 20 years after the exposure to radiation. Family history of thyroid cancer syndrome such as familial adenomatous polyposis, Carney complex, Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN-2), Werner syndrome, and Cowden syndrome increases the risk of getting papillary cancer. Papillary thyroid carcinoma is usually discovered on routine examination as an asymptomatic thyroid nodule that appears as a neck mass. In some instances, the mass may have produced local symptoms. This mass is normally referred to a fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNA) for investigation. FNA accuracy is very high and it is a process widely used in these cases. Other investigation methods include ultrasound imaging and nuclear scan. The ultrasound is a useful test to distinguish solid from cystic lesions and to identify calcifications. The thyroid ultrasound is also very effective to discover microcarcinomas, which refer to very small carcinomas (<1 cm). Papillary thyroid carcinomas are also discovered when a hard nodule is found in multinodular goiter, when enlarged cervical lymph nodes are detected, or when there are unidentified metastatic lesions elsewhere in the body. Expanding lesions found in the thyroid gland, especially if they are painful, should be examined as they may indicate the presence of papillary thyroid carcinoma."}

An infection will usually first manifest in fish by causing frayed and ragged fins. This is followed by the appearance of ulcerations on the skin, and subsequent epidermal loss, identifiable as white or cloudy, fungus-like patches \u2013 particularly on the gill filaments. Mucus often also accumulates on the gills, head and dorsal regions. Gills will change colour, either becoming light or dark brown, and may also manifest necrosis. Fish will breathe rapidly and laboriously as a sign of gill damage. Anorexia and lethargy are common, as are mortalities, especially in young fish. Bacteria can be isolated from gills, skin and the kidneys. For definitive diagnosis, the pathogen should then be cultured on reduced nutrient agar. Inhibiting contaminant growth on the agar by adding antibiotics and keeping the temperature at 37 \u00b0C should improve culture results. Colonies are small, 3\u20134 mm in diameter, and grow within 24 hours. They are characteristically rhizoid in structure and pale yellow in colour. Ulcerations develop within 24 to 48 hours.

Other symptoms may accompany the disease, including lethargy, color loss, redness around the infection site, loss of appetite and twitching or rubbing the body against objects. As Flavobacterium columnare is Gram-negative, fish can be treated with a combination of the antibiotics furan-2 and kanamycin administered together.

It is the most common type, followed by ileal atresia. An inherited form \u2013 familial multiple intestinal atresia \u2013 has also been described. This disorder was first reported in 1971. It is due to a mutation in the gene TTC7A on short arm of chromosome 2 (2p16). It is inherited as an autosomal recessive gene and is usually fatal in infancy. The most common cause of non-duodenal intestinal atresia is a vascular accident in utero that leads to decreased intestinal perfusion and ischemia of the respective segment of bowel. This leads to narrowing, or in the most severe cases, complete obliteration of the intestinal lumen. In the case that the superior mesenteric artery, or another major intestinal artery, is occluded, large segments of bowel can be entirely underdeveloped. Classically, the affected area of bowel assumes a spiral configuration and is described to have an \"apple peel\" like appearance; this is accompanied by lack of a dorsal mesentery. Ileal atresia can also result as a complication of meconium ileus. Intestinal atresias are often discovered before birth: either during a routine sonogram which shows a dilated intestinal segment due to the blockage, or by the development of polyhydramnios (the buildup of too much amniotic fluid in the uterus). These abnormalities are indications that the fetus may have a bowel obstruction which a more detailed ultrasound study can confirm. Some fetuses with bowel obstruction have abnormal chromosomes. An amniocentesis is recommended because it can determine not only the sex of the baby, but whether or not there is a problem with the chromosomes. Fetal and neonatal intestinal atresia are treated using laparotomy after birth. If the area affected is small, the surgeon may be able to remove the damaged portion and join the intestine back together. In instances where the narrowing is longer, or the area is damaged and cannot be used for period of time, a temporary stoma may be placed."}

Glycerol kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of glycerol by ATP, yielding ADP and glycerol-3-phosphate. It is more common in males because they only have one X chromosome, whereas females rarely manifest the disease because they have two X chromosomes. If hyperglycerolemia is caused by a mutation in the glycerol kinase gene then it generally causes an isolated glycerol kinase deficiency, resulting in the inability to synthesize triglycerides and glycerophospholipids. If hyperglycerolemia results from a deletion of the glycerol kinase gene then it often is part of a contiguous gene deletion syndrome with associated Duchenne muscular dystrophy and adrenal hypoplasia congenita. The Human Phenotype Ontology provided the following list of symptoms and signs for hyperglycerolemia: Abnormality of metabolism/homeostasis, Cognitive Deficit, EMG abnormality, Muscular Hypotonia, Myopathy, Neurological speech impairment, Primary adrenal insufficiency, Short stature, Cryptorchidism, EEG abnormality, Lumbar Hyperlordosis, Reduced bone mineral density, Scoliosis, Seizures, Abnormal facial shape, and Adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency is associated with the genetic disease X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita. If the glycerol kinase gene is deleted then the NROB1 gene is also often deleted, which causes X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita. Glycerol and glycerol kinase activity analyses are usually not offered by routine general medical laboratories. To diagnose hyperglycerolemia, blood and urine can be tested for the amounts of glycerol present. There are three clinical forms of GKD: infantile, juvenile, and adult. The infantile form is associated with severe developmental delay and results in a syndrome with Xp21 gene deletion with congenital adrenal hypoplasia and/or Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The infantile diagnosis is made by measuring plasma glycerol and is characterized by glycerol levels between 1. 8 and 8. 0 mmol/L and glyceroluria more than 360 mmol/24h. To confirm the diagnosis, genetic testing of the Xp21 gene is definitive. Children with GKD have severe hypoglycemic episodes and profound metabolic acidosis, or are completely symptom free. Individuals who are unable to form glucose from the glycerol released during triglyceride catabolism also the hypoglycemic episodes often disappear during adolescence. Patients with the juvenile and adult forms often have no symptoms and are diagnosed fortuitously when a medical professional tests for another medical condition."}

There is no documented case in the literature of degenerative retinoschisis itself (as opposed to the occasional situation of retinal detachment complicating retinoschisis) in which the splitting of the retina has progressed through the fovea. There is no clinical utility in differentiating between typical and reticular retinoschisis. Degenerative retinoschisis is not known to be a genetically inherited condition. There is always vision loss in the region of the schisis as the sensory retina is separated from the ganglion layer. But like the loss is in the periphery, it goes unnoticed. It is the very rare schisis that encroaches on the macula where retinopexy is then properly used. It is estimated that this much less common form of retinoschisis affects one in 5,000 to 25,000 individuals, primarily young males. Schisis is derived from the Greek word meaning splitting, describing the splitting of the retinal layers from each other. However, schisis is a word fragment, and the term retinoschisis should be used, as should the term iridoschisis when describing splitting of the iris. If the retinoschisis involves the macula, then the high-resolution central area of vision used to view detail is lost, and this one form of macular disease. Although it might be described by some as a \"degeneration\", the term macular degeneration should be reserved for the specific disease \"age-related macular degeneration\". Retinoschisis can be caused by an X-linked genetic defect, affecting the vision of men who inherit the disease from their unaffected carrier mothers. The genetic form of this disease usually starts during childhood and is called X-linked Juvenile Retinoschisis (XLRS) or Congenital Retinoschisis. Affected males are usually identified in grade school, but occasionally are identified as young infants."}

The resulting disability is permanent but does not progress.", "language": "en", "domain": "disease", "full_context": "The onset of paralysis (spastic paraparesis) is sudden and symmetrical and affects the legs more than the arms. The resulting disability is permanent but does not progress. Typically, a patient is standing and walking on the balls of the feet with rigid legs and often with ankle clonus. Initially, most patients experience generalized weakness during the first days and are bedridden for some days or weeks before trying to walk. Occasional blurred vision and/or speech difficulties typically clear during the first month, except in severely affected patients. Spasticity is present from the first day, without any initial phase of flaccidity. After the initial weeks of functional improvement, the spastic paraparesis remains stable for the rest of life. Some patients may suffer an abrupt aggravating episode, e. g. a sudden and permanent worsening of the spastic paraparesis. Such episodes are identical to the initial onset and can therefore be interpreted as a second onset. The severity of konzo varies; cases range from only hyperreflexia in the lower limbs to a severely disabled, bedridden patient with spastic paraparesis, associated weakness of the trunk and arms, impaired eye movements, speech and possibly visual impairment. Although the severity varies from patient to patient, the longest upper motor neurons are invariably more affected than the shorter ones. Thus, a konzo patient with speech impairment always shows severe symptoms in the legs and arms. Recently, neuropsychological effects of konzo have been described from DR Congo. The character of the neurological injury is not clear. The disease onset is associated with high intake of cyanide from a monotonous diet of bitter cassava, which is low in protein, particularly sulfur amino acids. These are essential for the detoxification in the body of cyanide to thiocyanate, which is removed in the urine. A number of studies implicate the combination of high cyanide intake from bitter cassava and low intake of sulfur amino acids as the cause. It has now been shown that the month by month incidence of konzo is significantly correlated with the percentage of children with high urinary thiocyanate content, which is a measure of their cyanide intake."}

This occurs due to the decreased amount of immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels in the infant during the three-month stage. This is followed by viral infections such as pneumonitis, an inflammation of the lung which produces common symptoms such as cough, fever, chills, and shortness of breath. A telltale sign of X-SCID is candidiasis, a type of fungal infection caused by Candida albicans. Candidiasis involves moist areas of the body such as skin, the mouth, respiratory tract, and vagina; symptoms of oral candidiasis include difficulty in swallowing, pain on swallowing and oral lesions. Recurrent eczema-like rashes are also a common symptom. Other common infections experienced by individuals with X-SCID include diarrhea, sepsis, and otitis media. Some other common symptoms that are experienced by X-SCID patients include failure to thrive, gut problems, skin problems, and muscle hypotonia. In some patients symptoms may not appear for the first six months after birth. This is likely due to passive immunity received from the mother in order to protect the baby from infections until the newborn is able to make its own antibodies. As a result, there can be a silent period where the baby displays no symptoms of X-SCID followed by the development of frequent infections. X-SCID is caused by a mutation occurring in the xq13. 1 locus of the X-chromosome. Most often, this disease affects males whose mother is a carrier (heterozygous) for the disorder. Because females have two X-chromosomes, the mother will not be affected by carrying only one abnormal X-chromosome, but any male children will have a 50% chance of being affected with the disorder by inheriting the faulty gene. Likewise, her female children will have a 50% chance of being carriers for the immunodeficiency. X-SCID can also arise through de novo mutations and can be prevented in females by X-inactivation. In X-inactivation the preferential selection of the non-mutant X chromosome during development results in the outcome that none of the mature female cells actively express the X-SCID mutation, they are immunologically unaffected and have no carrier burden. A de novo mutation is an alteration in a gene caused by the result of a mutation in a germ cell (egg or sperm) or in the fertilized egg itself, rather than having been inherited from a carrier. Since only 1/3 of all X-SCID patients have a positive family history of SCID, it is hypothesized that de novo mutations account for a significant percentage of cases."}

Other symptoms include failure to gain weight appropriately in infancy (failure to thrive) and low muscle tone. Individuals with Williams syndrome tend to have widely spaced teeth, a long philtrum, and a flattened nasal bridge. Most individuals with Williams syndrome are highly verbal relative to their IQ, and are overly sociable, having what has been described as a \"cocktail party\" type personality. Individuals with WS hyperfocus on the eyes of others in social engagements. Individuals with Williams syndrome experience many cardiac problems, commonly heart murmurs and the narrowing of major blood vessels as well as supravalvular aortic stenosis. Other symptoms may include gastrointestinal problems, such as severe or prolonged colic, abdominal pain and diverticulitis, nocturnal enuresis (bed wetting) and urinary difficulties, dental irregularities and defective tooth enamel, as well as hormone problems, the most common being high blood calcium. Hypothyroidism has been reported to occur in children, although there is no proof of it occurring in adults; adults with WS have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, with some cases apparent as young as 21 years old. Individuals with Williams syndrome often have hyperacusia and phonophobia which resembles noise-induced hearing loss, but this may be due to a malfunctioning auditory nerve. However, individuals with WS can also tend to demonstrate a love of music, and they appear significantly more likely to possess absolute pitch. There also appears to be a higher prevalence of left-handedness and left-eye dominance. Ophthalmologic issues are common in Williams syndrome. Up to 75% of subjects in some studies have strabismus (ocular misalignment), particularly esotropia, due to inherent subnormal binocular visual function and cognitive deficits in visuospatial construction. Individuals with Williams syndrome have problems with visual processing, but this is related to difficulty in dealing with complex spatial relationships rather than depth perception per se. Because of the multiple genes that are missing in people with Williams syndrome, there are many effects on the brain, including abnormalities in the cerebellum, right parietal lobe, and left frontal cortical regions. This pattern is consistent with the visual-spatial disabilities and problems with behavioral timing often seen in Williams syndrome. Frontal-cerebellar pathways, involved in behavioral timing, are often abnormally developed in individuals with Williams syndrome, which may be related to their deficits in coordination and execution of fine motor tasks such as drawing and writing. In addition, people with Williams syndrome often exhibit gross motor difficulties, including trouble walking down stairs, as well as overactive motor reflexes (hyperreflexia) and hyperactive, involuntary movement of the eyes (nystagmus). Williams syndrome is also noteworthy for exhibiting abnormalities in the parietal-dorsal areas of the neocortex, but not the ventral areas. The parietal-dorsal area handles visual processing that supports visual-spatial analysis of the environment, while the ventral is related to semantic recognition of visual stimuli, as well as the recognition of faces."}

Maternal glucose transferred across the placenta prevents hypoglycemia in a fetus with GSD I, but the liver is enlarged with glycogen at birth. The inability to generate and release glucose soon results in hypoglycemia, and occasionally in lactic acidosis fulminant enough to appear as a primary respiratory problem in the newborn period. Neurological manifestations are less severe than if the hypoglycemia were more acute. The brain's habituation to mild hypoglycemia is at least partly explained by use of alternative fuels, primarily lactate. More commonly, infants with GSD I tolerate without obvious symptoms a chronic, mild hypoglycemia, and compensated lactic acidosis between feedings. Blood glucose levels are typically 25 to 50 mg/dl (1. 4\u20132. 8 mM). These infants continue to need oral carbohydrates every few hours. Many never sleep through the night even in the second year of life. They may be pale, clammy, and irritable a few hours after a meal. Developmental delay is not an intrinsic or inevitable effect of glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency but is common if the diagnosis is not made in early infancy. Although mild hypoglycemia for much of the day may go unsuspected, the metabolic adaptations described above make severe hypoglycemic episodes, with unconsciousness or seizure, uncommon before treatment. Episodes which occur are likely to happen in the morning before breakfast."}

Of these, alcohol consumption is the most important. Causes of hyperuricemia can be classified into three functional types: increased production of uric acid, decreased excretion of uric acid, and mixed type. Causes of increased production include high levels of purine in the diet and increased purine metabolism. Causes of decreased excretion include kidney disease, certain drugs, and competition for excretion between uric acid and other molecules. Mixed causes include high levels of alcohol and/or fructose in the diet, and starvation. A purine-rich diet is a common but minor cause of hyperuricemia. Diet alone generally is not sufficient to cause hyperuricemia. Purine content of foods varies (see Gout). Foods high in the purines adenine and hypoxanthine may be more potent in exacerbating hyperuricemia. Hyperuricemia of this type is a common complication of solid organ transplant. Apart from normal variation (with a genetic component), tumor lysis syndrome produces extreme levels of uric acid, mainly leading to renal failure. The Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is also associated with extremely high levels of uric acid. The principal drugs that contribute to hyperuricemia by decreased excretion are the primary antiuricosurics. Other drugs and agents include diuretics, salicylates, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, nicotinic acid, ciclosporin, 2-ethylamino-1,3,4-thiadiazole, and cytotoxic agents. The gene SLC2A9 encodes a protein that helps to transport uric acid in the kidney. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms of this gene are known to have a significant correlation with blood uric acid. Hyperuricemia cosegregating with osteogenesis imperfecta has been shown to be associated with a mutation in GPATCH8 using exome sequencing A ketogenic diet impairs the ability of the kidney to excrete uric acid, due to competition for transport between uric acid and ketones."}

In some patients, UIP is diagnosed only when a more acute disease supervenes and brings the patient to medical attention. The cause of the scarring in UIP may be known (less commonly) or unknown (more commonly). Since the medical term for conditions of unknown cause is \"idiopathic\", the clinical term for UIP of unknown cause is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Examples of known causes of UIP include systemic sclerosis/scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, asbestosis, and prolonged use of medications such as nitrofurantoin or amiodarone. UIP may be diagnosed by a radiologist using computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, or by a pathologist using tissue obtained by a lung biopsy. Radiologically, the main feature required for a confident diagnosis of UIP is honeycomb change in the periphery and the lower portions (bases) of the lungs. The histologic hallmarks of UIP, as seen in lung tissue under a microscope by a pathologist, are interstitial fibrosis in a \"patchwork pattern\", honeycomb change and fibroblast foci (see images below). The differential diagnosis includes other types of lung disease that cause similar symptoms and show similar abnormalities on chest radiographs. Some of these diseases cause fibrosis, scarring or honeycomb change. The most common considerations include: - chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis - non-specific interstitial pneumonia - sarcoidosis - pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis - asbestosis Regardless of cause, UIP is relentlessly progressive, usually leading to respiratory failure and death without a lung transplant. Some patients do well for a prolonged period of time, but then deteriorate rapidly because of a superimposed acute illness (so-called \"accelerated UIP\"). The outlook for long-term survival is poor. In most studies, the median survival is 3 to 4 years. Patients with UIP in the setting of rheumatoid arthritis have a slightly better prognosis than UIP without a known cause (IPF). UIP, as a term, first appeared in the pathology literature. It was coined by Averill Abraham Liebow."}

Forms of the disease are Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the US, postpartum thyroiditis, subacute thyroiditis, silent thyroiditis, drug-induced thyroiditis, radiation-induced thyroiditis, acute thyroiditis, and Riedel's thyroiditis. Each different type of this disease has its own causes, clinical features, diagnoses, durations, resolutions, conditions and risks. There are many different signs and symptoms for thyroiditis, none of which are exclusively limited to this disease. Many of the signs imitate symptoms of other diseases, so thyroiditis can sometimes be difficult to diagnose. Common hypothyroid symptoms manifest when thyroid cell damage is slow and chronic, and may include fatigue, weight gain, feeling \"fuzzy headed\", depression, dry skin, and constipation. Other, rarer symptoms include swelling of the legs, vague aches and pains, decreased concentration and so on. When conditions become more severe, depending on the type of thyroiditis, one may start to see puffiness around the eyes, slowing of the heart rate, a drop in body temperature, or even incipient heart failure. On the other hand, if the thyroid cell damage is acute, the thyroid hormone within the gland leaks out into the bloodstream causing symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, which is similar to those of hyperthyroidism. These symptoms include weight loss, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, fast heart rate, and fatigue. Elevated levels of thyroid hormone in the bloodstream cause both conditions, but thyrotoxicosis is the term used with thyroiditis since the thyroid gland is not overactive, as in the case of hyperthyroidism. Thyroiditis is generally caused by an attack on the thyroid, resulting in inflammation and damage to the thyroid cells. This disease is often considered a malfunction of the immune system. Antibodies that attack the thyroid are what causes most types of thyroiditis. It can also be caused by an infection, like a virus or bacteria, which works in the same way as antibodies to cause inflammation in the glands. Certain people make thyroid antibodies, and thyroiditis can be considered an autoimmune disease, because the body acts as if the thyroid gland is foreign tissue. Some drugs, such as interferon and amiodarone, can also cause thyroiditis because they have a tendency to damage thyroid cells. The most common and helpful way to diagnose thyroiditis is first for a physician to palpate the thyroid gland during a physical examination. Laboratory tests allow doctors to evaluate the patient for elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rates, elevated thyroglobulin levels, and depressed radioactive iodine uptake (Mather, 2007). Blood tests also help to determine the kind of thyroiditis and to see how much thyroid stimulating hormone the pituitary gland is producing and what antibodies are present in the body."}

NBS is caused by a mutation in the NBS1 gene. It is thus not surprising that many of the features are similar to ataxia telangiectasia (AT), and this syndrome is sometimes termed AT-variant 1; in AT, an abnormal ATM protein, the normal correlate of which interacts with the MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 (MRN) complex. NBS is caused by a mutation in the NBS1 gene, located at human chromosome 8q21. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome (chromosome 8 is an autosome), and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder. Two adult siblings, both heterozygous for two particular NBS1 nonsense mutations displayed cellular sensitivity to radiation, chromosome instability and fertility defects, but not the developmental defects that are typically found in other NBS patients. These individuals appear to be primarily defective in homologous recombination, a process that accurately repairs double-strand breaks, both in somatic cells and during meiosis. There is no treatment for NBS, however in those with agammaglobulinemia, intravenous immunoglobulin may be started. Prophylactic antibiotics are considered to prevent urinary tract infections as those with NBS often have congenital kidney malformations. In the treat of malignancies radiation, alkylating antineoplastic agents, and epipodophyllotoxins are not used, and methotrexate can be used with caution and, the dose should be limited. Bone marrow transplants and hematopoietic stem cells transplants are also considered in the treatment of NBS. The supplementation of Vitamin E is also recommended. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt can be placed in patients with hydrocephaly, and surgical intervention of congenital deformities is also attempted. A review from 2000 stated that life expectancy was reduced because of a tendency to develop cancer relatively early as well as deaths due to infections related to immunodeficiency."}

Signs of damage to the retina caused by hypertension include: - Arteriolar changes, such as generalized arteriolar narrowing, focal arteriolar narrowing, arteriovenous nicking, changes in the arteriolar wall (arteriosclerosis) and abnormalities at points where arterioles and venules cross. Manifestations of these changes include Copper wire arterioles where the central light reflex occupies most of the width of the arteriole and Silver wire arterioles where the central light reflex occupies all of the width of the arteriole, and \"arterio-venular (AV) nicking\" or \"AV nipping\", due to venous constriction and banking. - advanced retinopathy lesions, such as microaneurysms, blot hemorrhages and/or flame hemorrhages, ischemic changes (e. g. \"cotton wool spots\"), hard exudates and in severe cases swelling of the optic disc (optic disc edema), a ring of exudates around the retina called a \"macular star\" and visual acuity loss, typically due to macular involvement. Mild signs of hypertensive retinopathy can be seen quite frequently in normal people (3\u201314% of adult individuals aged \u226540 years), even without hypertension. Hypertensive retinopathy is commonly considered a diagnostic feature of a hypertensive emergency although it is not invariably present. There is an association between the grade of retinopathy and mortality. In a classic study in 1939 Keith and colleagues described the prognosis of people with differing severity of retinopathy. They showed 70% of those with grade 1 retinopathy were alive after 3 years whereas only 6% of those with grade 4 survived. The most widely used modern classification system bears their name. The role of retinopathy grading in risk stratification is debated, but it has been proposed that individuals with signs of hypertensive retinopathy signs, especially retinal hemorrhages, microaneurysms and cotton-wool spots, should be assessed carefully. The changes in hypertensive retinopathy result from damage and adaptive changes in the arterial and arteriolar circulation in response to the high blood pressure. Several other diseases can result in retinopathy that can be confused with hypertensive retinopathy. These include diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy due to autoimmune disease, anemia, radiation retinopathy, and central retinal vein occlusion. A major aim of treatment is to prevent, limit, or reverse target organ damage by lowering the person's high blood pressure to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and death. Treatment with antihypertensive medications may be required to control the high blood pressure."}

Globally, athlete's foot affects about 15% of the population. Tinea pedis is caused by fungi such as Epidermophyton floccosum or fungi of the Trichophyton genus including T. rubrum and T. mentagrophytes. These fungi are typically transmitted in moist communal areas where people go barefoot, such as around swimming pools or in showers, and require a warm moist environment like the inside of a shoe to incubate. Fungal infection of the foot may be acquired (or reacquired) in many ways, such as by walking in an infected locker room, by using an infested bathtub, by sharing a towel used by someone with the disease, by touching the feet with infected fingers (such as after scratching another infected area of the body), or by wearing fungi-contaminated socks or shoes. Infection can often be prevented by keeping the feet dry by limiting the use of footwear that enclose the feet, or by remaining barefoot. The fungi may infect or spread to other areas of the body (such as by scratching one's feet and then touching one's groin). For each location on the body, the name of the condition changes. A fungal infection of the groin is called Tinea cruris, or commonly \"jock itch\". The fungi tend to spread to areas of skin that are kept warm and moist, such as with insulation (clothes), body heat, and sweat. However, the spread of the infection is not limited to skin. Toe nails become infected with fungi in the same way as the rest of the foot, typically by being trapped with fungi in the warm, dark, moist inside of a shoe. Fungal infection of the nails is called tinea unguium, and is not included in the medical definition of \"athlete's foot\", even though toe nails are part of the foot. Fungi are more difficult to kill inside and underneath a nail than on and in the skin. But if the nail infection is not cured, then the fungi can readily spread back to the rest of the foot. The fungi can also spread to hair, grow inside hair strands, and feed on the keratin within hair, including the hair on the feet, the hair of one's beard, and the hair on one's head.

Traditionally it was thought that it presented with haemodynamic shock \"out of proportion\" with blood loss, however blood loss has often been underestimated. The parasympathetic effect of traction on the uterine ligaments may cause bradycardia. Principles of management are to treat the shock and replace the uterus. The patient should be moved rapidly to the OR to facilitate anesthesia monitoring during this procedure. Usually this complication is only recognized after delivery of the placenta, wherein pitocin has already been started, which just exacerbates the problem. The uterus clamps down around the inversion making it very difficult to perform a replacement. This is a true obstetrical emergency, so extra doctors, nurses, anesthesiologists should be summoned to the room to assist. The pitocin should be turned off immediately. Giving tocolytics such as terbutaline or magnesium sulfate have a lower success rate. Halothane and Nitroglycerine (100mcg to 200 mcg intravenously) have a higher success rate. Once you have achieved uterine relaxation, place your fist into the vagina. Find the biggest part of the inversion and push with your fist cephalward to replace the uterus. This takes firm steady force, so keep your fist in the vagina if you need to rest your hand. Then continue more force toward the fundus to replace the uterus. You can use your left hand on the outside of the abdomen to help you feel where the fundus should be replaced. This helps guide the angle of your fist in replacing the uterus.

It has also been shown to be caused by deficiency in certain minerals, such as copper and zinc. Pseudoleukopenia can develop upon the onset of infection. The leukocytes (predominately neutrophils, responding to injury first) start migrating toward the site of infection, where they can be scanned. Their migration causes bone marrow to produce more WBCs to combat infection as well as to restore the leukocytes in circulation, but as the blood sample is taken upon the onset of infection, it contains low amount of WBCs, which is why it is termed \"pseudoleukopenia\". Certain medications can alter the number and function of white blood cells. Medications that can cause leukopenia include clozapine, an antipsychotic medication with a rare adverse effect leading to the total absence of all granulocytes (neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils). The antidepressant and smoking addiction treatment drug bupropion HCl (Wellbutrin) can also cause leukopenia with long-term use. Minocycline, a commonly prescribed antibiotic, is another drug known to cause leukopenia. There are also reports of leukopenia caused by divalproex sodium or valproic acid (Depakote), a drug used for epilepsy (seizures), mania (with bipolar disorder) and migraine. The anticonvulsant drug, lamotrigine, has been associated with a decrease in white blood cell count. The FDA monograph for metronidazole states that this medication can also cause leukopenia, and the prescriber information suggests a complete blood count, including differential cell count, before and after, in particular, high-dose therapy. Immunosuppressive drugs, such as sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, ciclosporin, leflunomide and TNF inhibitors, have leukopenia as a known complication. Interferons used to treat multiple sclerosis, such as interferon beta-1a and interferon beta-1b, can also cause leukopenia. Chemotherapy targets cells that grow rapidly, such as tumors, but can also affect white blood cells, because they are characterized by bone marrow as rapid growing.

Desmoid tumour of the breast may present a difficulty in the diagnosis especially where imaging studies are not conclusive and suggest a more ominous diagnosis. Treatment may consist of watching and waiting, complete surgical removal, radiation therapy, antiestrogens (ex. Tamoxifen), NSAIDs, chemotherapy or microwave ablation. Patients with desmoid tumors should be evaluated by a multi-disciplinary team of surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, geneticists and nurses. There is no cure for desmoid tumors and when possible patients are encouraged to enlist in clinical trials. A biopsy is always indicated as the definitive method to determine nature of the tumour.

Conversely, for intra-abdominal fibromatosis without evidence of FAP, although extensive surgery may still be required for local symptoms, the risk of recurrence appears to be lower. Wide surgical resection with clear margins is the most widely practiced technique with radiation, chemotherapy, or hormonal therapy being used to reduce the risk of recurrence. Current experimental studies are being done with Gleevec (Imatinib) and Nexavar (sorafenib) for treatment of desmoid tumors, and show promising success rates."}

While not present at birth, many affected boys develop kidney problems at about one year of age. Renal pathology is characterized by an abnormal loss of certain substances into the urine, including bicarbonate, sodium, potassium, amino acids, organic acids, albumin, calcium and L-carnitine, this problem, is known as Fanconi-type renal tubular dysfunction. This syndrome is caused by mutations in the OCRL1 gene which encodes a inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase. At least one mechanism by which these mutations cause this syndrome is by loss of its Rab binding domain. This protein is associated with the primary cilia of the retinal pigment epithelial cells, fibroblasts and kidney tubular cells. This suggests that this syndrome is due to dysfunction of the cilia in these cells. About 120 mutations are associated with this condition and OCRL gene which is associated with oculocerebrorenal syndrome Diagnosis of oculocerebrorenal syndrome can be done via genetic testing Among the different investigations that can de done are: - Urinalysis - MRI - Blood test In terms of treatment of oculocerebrorenal syndrome for those individuals who are affected by this condition includes the following: - Glaucoma control (via medication) - Nasogastric tube feeding - Physical therapy - Clomipramine - Potassium citrate It was first described in 1952 by Charles Lowe and colleagues at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.

Limb sparing surgery, as opposed to amputation, can now be used to save the limbs of patients in at least 90% of extremity tumor cases. Additional treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy, may be administered before and/or after surgery. Chemotherapy significantly improves the prognosis for many sarcoma patients, especially those with bone sarcomas. Treatment can be a long and arduous process, lasting about a year for many patients. - Liposarcoma treatment consists of surgical resection, with chemotherapy not being used outside of the investigative setting. Adjuvant radiotherapy may also be used after surgical excision for liposarcoma. - Rhabdomyosarcoma is treated with surgery, radiotherapy, and/or chemotherapy. The majority of rhabdomyosarcoma patients have a 50\u201385% survival rate. - Osteosarcoma is treated with surgical resection of as much of the cancer as possible, often along with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Radiotherapy is a second alternative although not as successful. Sarcomas are given a number of different names based on the type of tissue that they most closely resemble. For example, osteosarcoma resembles bone, chondrosarcoma resembles cartilage, liposarcoma resembles fat, and leiomyosarcoma resembles smooth muscle. In addition to being named based on the tissue of origin, sarcomas are also assigned a grade (low, intermediate, or high) based on the presence and frequency of certain cellular and subcellular characteristics associated with malignant biological behavior. Low grade sarcomas are usually treated surgically, although sometimes radiation therapy or chemotherapy are used. Intermediate and high grade sarcomas are more frequently treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Since higher grade tumors are more likely to undergo metastasis (invasion and spread to locoregional and distant sites), they are treated more aggressively. The recognition that many sarcomas are sensitive to chemotherapy has dramatically improved the survival of patients. For example, in the era before chemotherapy, long-term survival for patients with localized osteosarcoma was only approximately 20%, but now has risen to 60\u201370%. Sarcomas are quite rare with only 15,000 new cases per year in the United States."}

The primary form of hearing loss in otosclerosis is conductive hearing loss (CHL) whereby sounds reach the ear drum but are incompletely transferred via the ossicular chain in the middle ear, and thus partly fail to reach the inner ear (cochlea). This usually will begin in one ear but will eventually affect both ears with a variable course. On audiometry, the hearing loss is characteristically low-frequency, with higher frequencies being affected later. Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) has also been noted in patients with otosclerosis; this is usually a high-frequency loss, and usually manifests late in the disease. The causal link between otosclerosis and SNHL remains controversial. Over the past century, leading otologists and neurotologic researchers have argued whether the finding of SNHL late in the course of otosclerosis is due to otosclerosis or simply to typical presbycusis. Most patients with otosclerosis notice tinnitus (head noise) to some degree. The amount of tinnitus is not necessarily related to the degree or type of hearing impairment. Tinnitus develops due to irritation of the delicate nerve endings in the inner ear. Since the nerve carries sound, this irritation is manifested as ringing, roaring or buzzing. It is usually worse when the patient is fatigued, nervous or in a quiet environment. It may be that a genetic tendency to develop otosclerosis is inherited by some people. Then a trigger, such as a viral infection (like measles), actually causes the condition to develop. The disease can be considered to be hereditary, but its penetrance and the degree of expression is so highly variable that it may be difficult to detect an inheritance pattern. Most of the implicated genes are transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. One genome-wide analysis associates otosclerosis with variation in RELN gene.

The most serious and rare form of latex allergy, Type I hypersensitivity can cause an immediate and potentially life-threatening reaction, not unlike the severe reaction some people have to bee stings. Such reactions account for a significant proportion of perioperative anaphylactic reaction, especially in children with myelomeningocele. Type I natural rubber latex allergy is an IgE (immune) mediated reaction to proteins found in the Hevea brasiliensis tree, a type of rubber tree. Testing for type I natural rubber latex allergy is through blood testing to determine if the patient is producing IgE antibodies to latex proteins. Anaphylactic shock can be provoked in allergic persons by the previous use of latex in an area: latex is typically powdered to prevent sticking, latex proteins become attached to the particles of powder, and the powder becomes airborne when the latex item is used, triggering potentially life-threatening Type I reactions when the latex-contaminated powder is inhaled by susceptible persons. In radiological units latex allergy may mimic contrast medium allergy Type IV allergy, also known as allergic contact dermatitis, involves a delayed skin rash that is similar to poison ivy with blistering and oozing of the skin (see urushiol-induced contact dermatitis). It can be diagnosed through a positive skin patch test, although a negative test does not rule out a latex allergy. Severe irritation takes place if a latex catheter is inserted in the urinary tract of a person allergic to latex. That is especially severe in case of a radical prostatectomy due to the open wound there and the exposure lasting e. g. two weeks. Intense pain may indicate such situation. Natural rubber latex can also cause irritant contact dermatitis, a less severe form of reaction that does not involve the immune system. Contact dermatitis causes dry, itchy, irritated areas on the skin, most often on the hands. Latex-glove induced dermatitis increases the chance of hospital-acquired infections, including blood-borne infections, being transmitted. People who have latex allergy also may have or develop an allergic response to some plants and/or products of these plants such as fruits. This is known as the latex-fruit syndrome.

OMD are patterns involving oral and/orofacial musculature that interferes with normal growth, development, or function of structures, or calls attention to itself. OMD are found in both children and adults. OMD that are commonly seen in children include tongue thrust that is also known as swallowing with an anterior tongue posture. OMD also refers to factors such as nonnutritive sucking behaviors, such as thumb sucking, clenching, bruxing, etc. that led to abnormal development of dentition and oral cavity. OMD in adult and geriatric population are due to various neurological impairments, oral hygiene, altered functioning of muscles due to aging, systemic diseases, etc. Tongue thrusting is a type of orofacial myofunctional disorder, which is defined as habitual resting or thrusting the tongue forward and/or sideways against or between the teeth while swallowing, chewing, resting, or speaking. Abnormal swallowing patterns push the upper teeth forward and away from the upper alveolar processes and cause open bites. In children, tongue thrusting is common due to immature oral behavior, narrow dental arch, prolonged upper respiratory tract infections, spaces between the teeth (diastema), muscle weakness, malocclusion, abnormal sucking habits, and open mouth posture due to structural abnormalities of genetic origin. Large tonsils and adenoids also contribute to tongue thrust swallowing. From the dental perspective, teeth move in relation to the balance of the soft tissue; the normal relationship of teeth lies in occlusion; and any deviation from the normal occlusion can lead to dental distress. Tongue posture plays an important role in swallowing and dentofacial growth. In case of tongue thrust swallowing, the tip of the tongue can come against or between the dentition; the midpoint may be collapsed or extended unilaterally or bilaterally; or the posterior part of the hard palate. In these conditions, there are chances of abnormal dentofacial growth and other concerns regarding development of the craniofacial complex. There are pertinent symptomatic questions that can be considered for the diagnosis of tongue thrust swallow. Some of these questions are geared toward tongue protrusion and an opening of lips when the client is in repose; habitual mouth breathing; digit sucking; existence of high and narrow palatal arch; ankyloglossia (tongue-tie); malocclusions, (Class II, III); weak chewing muscles (masseter); weak lip muscles (orbicularis oris); overdeveloped chin muscles (mentalis); muscular imbalance; abnormal dentition. Tongue thrusting and speech problems may co-occur. Due to unconventional postures of the tongue and other articulators, interdental and frontal lisping are very common. The alveolar sounds /s/ and /z/ are produced more anteriorly thus leading to interdental fricative like sounds, /th/."}

The defect involves the whole area of the junction of the upper and lower chambers of the heart, i. e. where the atria join the ventricles. There is a large hole between the lower portion of the atria and the upper or `inlet' portion of the ventricles and this is associated with a significant abnormality of the valves separating the atria from the ventricles. The valves in effect become a common atrio-ventricular valve, and the severity of the defect depends largely on the supporting attachments of the valve to the ventricles and whether the valve allows dominant flow from the right atrium to right ventricle and from left atrium to left ventricle (\"unbalanced\" flow). The overall problems are similar to those of VSD but are more complicated. There is an increased flow of blood to the lungs through both the ventricular and atrial components of the defect. In addition, the abnormal atrio-ventricular valve invariably leaks, so that when the ventricles contract, blood flows not only forwards to the body and the lungs, but also backwards into the atria. The back-pressure effect on the atria causes congestion of blood in the left atrium in particular, and this in turn causes congestion in the veins draining the lungs. The effect on the baby is to worsen the heart failure that is associated with an isolated VSD and to hasten the onset of pulmonary hypertension. It should be mentioned that CAVSD is found in approximately one-third of babies who have Down syndrome, but it also occurs as an isolated abnormality. Symptoms include difficulty breathing (dyspnea) and bluish discoloration on skin and lips (cyanosis). A newborn baby will show signs of heart failure such as edema, fatigue, wheezing, sweating and irregular heartbeat. If there is a defect in the septum, it is possible for blood to travel from the left side of the heart to the right side of the heart, or the other way around. Since the right side of the heart contains venous blood with a low oxygen content, and the left side of the heart contains arterial blood with a high oxygen content, it is beneficial to prevent any communication between the two sides of the heart and prevent the blood from the two sides of the heart from mixing with each other. Down syndrome is often associated with AVCD. Other risk factors include: having a parent with a congenital heart defect, alcohol use while pregnant, uncontrolled diabetes treatment during pregnancy and some medications during pregnancy."}

The presence of certain mutations in genes has no relation with the phenotype i. e. any resulting physical traits or abnormality. - The second cause is a deletion or mutation of a single gene. GKD is described by mendelian inheritance and is an X-linked recessive trait due to which it occurs mainly in males and occasionally in females. GKD results when the glycerol kinase gene present on the locus Xp21 of the X chromosome is either deleted or mutated. Females have two X chromosomes and males have one X and one Y chromosome. The expression of recessive genes on the X chromosome is different in males and females. This is due to the fact that genes present on the Y chromosome do not pair up with genes on the X chromosome in males. In females the disorder is expressed only when there are two copies of the affected gene present on each X chromosome but since the glycerol kinase gene is present only on one X chromosome the disorder is not expressed in women. Women have a second good copy that can compensate for the defect on the first copy. On the other hand, males only need a single copy of the recessive gene for the disorder to be expressed.

A shower of floaters or any loss of vision, too, is a medical emergency. Risk factors for retinal detachment include severe myopia, retinal tears, trauma, family history, as well as complications from cataract surgery. Retinal detachment can be mitigated in some cases when the warning signs are caught early. The most effective means of prevention and risk reduction is through education of the initial signs, and encouragement for people to seek ophthalmic medical attention if they have symptoms suggestive of a posterior vitreous detachment. Early examination allows detection of retinal tears which can be treated with laser or cryotherapy. This reduces the risk of retinal detachment in those who have tears from around 1:3 to 1:20. For this reason, the governing bodies in some sports require regular eye examination. Trauma-related cases of retinal detachment can occur in high-impact sports or in high speed sports. Although some recommend avoiding activities that increase pressure in the eye, including diving and skydiving, there is little evidence to support this recommendation, especially in the general population. Nevertheless, ophthalmologists generally advise people with high degrees of myopia to try to avoid exposure to activities that have the potential for trauma, increase pressure on or within the eye itself, or include rapid acceleration and deceleration, such as bungee jumping or roller coaster rides. Intraocular pressure spikes occur during any activity accompanied by the Valsalva maneuver, including weightlifting. An epidemiological study suggests that heavy manual lifting at work may be associated with increased risk of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, but this relationship is not strong. In this study, obesity also appeared to increase the risk of retinal detachment. A high Body Mass Index (BMI) and elevated blood pressure have been identified as a risk factor in non-myopic individuals. Genetic factors promoting local inflammation and photoreceptor degeneration may also be involved in the development of the disease. Other risk factors include the following: - Glaucoma - AIDS - Cataract surgery - Diabetic retinopathy - Eclampsia - Family history of retinal detachment - Homocysteinuria - Malignant hypertension - Metastatic cancer, which spreads to the eye (eye cancer) - Retinoblastoma - Severe myopia - Smoking and passive smoking - Stickler syndrome - Von Hippel-Lindau disease Retinal detachment can be examined by fundus photography or ophthalmoscopy. Fundus photography generally needs a considerably larger instrument than the ophthalmoscope, but has the advantage of availing the image to be examined by a specialist at another location and/or time, as well as providing photo documentation for future reference. Modern fundus photographs generally recreate considerably larger areas of the fundus than what can be seen at any one time with handheld ophthalmoscopes."}

Additionally, branches of glucose are formed off of the chain by \u03b1-1,6-glycosidic bonds. 2 molecules of glucose are joined into an \u03b1-1,4-glycosidic bonds by an enzyme known as glycogen synthase.

Glycogen branching enzyme is responsible for the required \u03b1-1,6-glycosidic bonds needed to start a branch off of these linear chains. Any disruption to this system results in a glycogen storage disease. There are currently 2 subcategories of glycogen storage diseases in horses: Type 1 polysaccharide storage myopathy, glycogen branching enzyme deficiency, and Type 2 polysaccharide storage myopathy. Type 1 PSSM is caused by an autosomal dominant genetic mutation known as GSY1. This mutation causes an up-regulation of glycogen synthase, and high levels of glycogen synthase relative to glycogen branching enzyme (GBE). This altered ratio of glycogen synthase to GBE results in glycogen molecules with long chains and few branches, making these molecules somewhat amylase resistant. The GSY1 mutation is associated with altered glucose metabolism (but normal glycogen metabolism), as well as accumulation of high levels of glycogen and abnormal polysaccharide in the muscles of the horse. Additionally, some horses have been shown to have insulin sensitivity, which improves glucose uptake by muscle cells and contributes to excessive glycogen storage that is already elevated secondary to the GSY1 mutation. Low levels of glycogen branching enzyme leads to a condition known as glycogen-branching enzyme deficiency. This condition is caused by a mutation of the GBE1 gene responsible for producing the glycogen branching enzyme. Subsequently, glycogen molecules are produced with few branches, which greatly decreasing the number of nonreducing ends, drastically slowing the rate as which the molecule can be synthesized or broken down. This causes low levels of muscle glycogen that is very resistant to amylase. This disease is usually seen in Quarter Horse foals and is fatal. Type 2 PSSM is a category for disorders that lead to abnormal deposition of glycogen in the skeletal muscles of the horse that is not due to mutations in GSY1 or GBE1. PSSM is most prevalent in American Quarter Horses and their related breeds (Paint horse, Appaloosa, Appendix Quarter Horse), Draft horse breeds (especially Belgian Draft and Percherons), and Warmblood breeds."}

Of those who do develop symptoms, the primary infection is most often respiratory, with symptoms resembling bronchitis or pneumonia that resolve over a matter of a few weeks. In endemic regions, coccidioidomycosis is responsible for 20% of cases of community-acquired pneumonia. Notable coccidioidomycosis signs and symptoms include a profound feeling of tiredness, fever, cough, headaches, rash, muscle pain, and joint pain. Fatigue can persist for many months after initial infection. The classic triad of coccidioidomycosis known as \"desert rheumatism\" includes the combination of fever, joint pains, and erythema nodosum. Nearly 3% to 5% of infected individuals do not recover from the initial acute infection and develop a chronic infection. This can take the form of chronic lung infection or widespread disseminated infection (affecting the tissues lining the brain, soft tissues, joints, and bone). Chronic infection is responsible for most of the morbidity and mortality. Chronic fibrocavitary disease is manifested by cough, sputum, fevers, night sweats and weight loss. Osteomyelitis, including involvement of the spine, and meningitis which may occur months to years after initial infection. Severe lung disease may develop in HIV-infected persons. After Coccidioides infection, coccidioidomycosis begins with Valley fever, which is its initial acute form. Valley fever may progress to the chronic form and then to disseminated coccidioidomycosis. Therefore, Coccidioidomycosis may be divided into the following types: Serious complications may occur in patients who have weakened immune systems, including severe pneumonia with respiratory failure and bronchopleural fistulas requiring resection, lung nodules, and possible disseminated form, where the infection spreads throughout the body. The disseminated form of coccidioidomycosis can devastate the body, causing skin ulcers, abscesses, bone lesions, swollen joints with severe pain, heart inflammation, urinary tract problems, and inflammation of the brain's lining, which can lead to death. It must rain first to start the cycle of initial growth of the fungus underneath the soil. In soil (and in agar media), Coccidioides exist in filament form. It forms hyphae in both horizontal and vertical directions. Over a prolonged dry period, cells within hyphae degenerate to form alternating barrel-shaped cells (arthroconidia)."}

Most commonly, however, people seem to associate coprolalia with Tourette syndrome. When it comes to Tourette syndrome, the pathology of what causes this type of tic is not well pinpointed, but there are several correlations. First of all, some research has pinpointed decreased grey matter thickness within the insula and sensorimotor cortex as the cause of some cases. Research notes that behavioral and functional brain imaging evidence indicates that the premonitory sensory phenomena (PSP) is associated with brain activity in the insular cortex, which is linked to interoceptive awareness. In the results of this research, it is noted that increased tic severity scores are associated with premonitory urges. Along with this, there is also evidence for the involvement of the insular cortex in the perception of urges. When conducting the research, the researchers of this report found that there was a relationship between grey matter thickness and PSP and that premonitory urges in Tourette syndrome are inversely associated with grey matter thickness in the sensorimotor and insular cortices. [30] Another possibility when it comes to Tourette syndrome is genetics. In a study conducted in 2017, researchers found that there was a possible genetic and neurobiological relationship of the disinhibition phenotype in Tourette syndrome patients. However, it is noted that more research would be needed to determine a direct relationship. [31] Coprolalia is not unique to tic disorders; it is also a rare symptom of other neurological disorders. [9][10] It may occur after injuries to the brain such as stroke[10] and encephalitis;[10][11] in other neurological conditions such as choreoacanthocytosis,[12] seizures,[13] and Lesch\u2013Nyhan syndrome;[14] and rarely in persons with dementia or obsessive- compulsive disorder in the absence of tics. [10] Coprolalia encompasses words and phrases that are culturally taboo or generally unsuitable for acceptable social use, when used out of context. The term is not used to describe contextual swearing. It is usually expressed out of social or emotional context, and may be spoken in a louder tone or different cadence or pitch than normal conversation. It can be a single word, or complex phrases. A person with coprolalia may repeat the word mentally rather than saying it out loud; these subvocalizations can be very distressing. Coprolalia is an occasional characteristic of Tourette syndrome, although it is not required for a diagnosis of Tourette's. In Tourette syndrome, compulsive swearing can be uncontrollable and undesired by the person uttering the phrases."}

Parathyroid cancer has also been associated with external radiation exposure, but, most reports describe an association between radiation and the more common parathyroid adenoma. Parathyroid carcinoma is sometimes diagnosed during surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism. If the surgeon suspects carcinoma based on severity or invasion of surrounding tissues by a firm parathyroid tumor, aggressive excision is performed, including the thyroid and surrounding tissues as necessary. Agents such as calcimimetics (for example, cinacalcet) are used to mimic calcium and are able to activate the parathyroid calcium-sensing receptor (making the parathyroid gland \"think\" we have more calcium than we actually do), therefore lowering the calcium level, in an attempt to decrease the hypercalcemia."}

In 1997, six cases of Haff disease were reported in California and Missouri, all after the consumption of buffalo fish (Ictiobus cyprinellus). In July and August 2010, dozens of people contracted rhabdomyolysis after eating Procambarus clarkii in Nanjing, China. A month later, the Chinese authorities claimed they were victims of Haff disease. An outbreak was reported in Brooklyn, New York on 18 November 2011, when two household members were stricken by the syndrome after eating buffalo fish. On February 4, 2014 two cases of Haff Disease were reported in Cook County, Illinois following the consumption of buffalo fish. A group from Brazil has recently identified a Haff Disease outbreak in Bahia state with 71 cases identified. The exact nature of the poison is still unclear. In the U. S. outbreak, the source of the fish was traced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and studies of other fish from the same sources showed a hexane-soluble (and hence non-polar lipid) substance that induced similar symptoms in mice; other food-borne poisons commonly found in fish could not be detected. It cannot be inactivated by cooking, as all six CDC cases had consumed cooked or fried fish. Palytoxin has been proposed as a disease model. It has also been suggested that the toxin may have thiaminase activity (i. e. it degrades thiamine, also known as vitamin B1)."}

Some develop chronic regurgitation and anorexia (lack of appetite or refusal to feed). However, not all infected snakes may regurgitate. Boas lose weight and may develop clogged nares (nostrils), stomatitis, or secondary pneumonia. The disease can rapidly progress to produce nervous-system disorders, such as disorientation, corkscrewing of the head and neck, holding the head in abnormal and unnatural positions, rolling onto the back, or stargazing. Stomatitis, pneumonia, undifferentiated cutaneous sarcomas, lymphoproliferative disorders, and leukemia have all been observed in affected specimens. Burmese pythons generally show signs of central nervous system disease without manifestation of other clinical signs and regurgitation is seen only in boas. These are symptoms similar to those seen in specimens infected by Chlamydia\u2013specifically Chlamydophila psittaci, the so-called parrot's disease. Several snakes have been seen with proliferative pneumonia, while inclusions are commonly seen in the liver, kidney, and pancreas. Cases have also been observed where with only very few inclusions. In a few snakes with signs of central nervous system disease, and with a severe encephalitis, no inclusions have been seen in any cells. While the presence of characteristic inclusions is diagnostic for the disease, the absence of such inclusions does not necessarily indicate that the snake is not diseased or is free from the IBD virus. While cells having inclusions may show mild degenerative changes, inflammation is rarely seen in visceral tissues. In the brain, mild to severe encephalitis occurs, with lymphocytic perivascular cuffing. Several snakes with lymphoproliferative disorders have been identified with lymphoid infiltrates in multiple organs. The primary route of transmission has not yet been identified, but direct contact may result in its transmission to developing embryos in viviparous species and eggs in oviparous species. Venereal transmission is also indicated as a possibility. The snake mite, Ophionyssus natricis, has been implicated as a possible vector for the virus, since mite infestations are commonly seen in epizootics of IBD and in captive specimens of these snakes."}

These dreams often involve kicking, screaming, punching, grabbing, and even jumping out of bed. When awakened, people can usually recall the dream they were having, which will match the actions they were performing, but they will not be aware that they were moving. In a normal sleep cycle, REM sleep may be experienced at intervals of between 90 minutes and two hours every night, which means RBD episodes may occur up to four times a night. In a rare case, they may only happen once a week or once a month. Episodes occur more towards the morning hours because that is when REM sleep is more frequent. The actions in an episode can result in injuries to oneself or one's bed partner. People can also respond to other people while sleeping and not even know it. This causes them to be aware of things while they are sleeping, which can result in sleep deprivation. Rapid eye movement behavior disorder (RBD) occurs when there is a loss of normal voluntary muscle atonia during REM sleep resulting in motor behavior in response to dream content. It can be caused by adverse reactions to certain drugs or during drug withdrawal; however, it is most often associated with the elderly and in those with neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, for example multiple system atrophy and Lewy body dementia. RBD is categorized as either idiopathic or symptomatic. Idiopathic RBD is when the individual's sleep structure seems to be normal but there is a significant increase in the density of REM sleep as well as the percentage of slow wave sleep. This category of RBD is more strongly linked to having a genetic component, as seen throughout familial gene patterns. Symptomatic RBD is the more characteristically seen disorder. This category of RBD is strongly associated with neurodegenerative diseases. About 15% of Parkinson's patients also have RBD, 70% of multiple system atrophy patients also have RBD, and about 85% of Lewy body dementia patients also have RBD. Other reported neurological associations include Shy\u2013Drager syndrome, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, multiple sclerosis, vascular encephalopathies, Tourette's syndrome, and Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome. It is uncertain whether RBD precedes these neurodegenerative disorders, whether they coincide, or whether it follows these disorders. However, Mayo Clinic researchers have characterized RBD as the strongest predictor of whether a male patient is developing Lewy body dementia."}

This can often be distressing to those who are undiagnosed, and sometimes it can be obstructive. If someone with Raynaud's is placed into a cold climate, it could potentially become dangerous. 1. When exposed to cold temperatures, the blood supply to the fingers or toes, and in some cases the nose or earlobes, is markedly reduced; the skin turns pale or white (called pallor) and becomes cold and numb. 2. When the oxygen supply is depleted, the skin color turns blue (called cyanosis). 3. These events are episodic, and when the episode subsides or the area is warmed, the blood flow returns, and the skin color first turns red (rubor), and then back to normal, often accompanied by swelling, tingling, and a painful \"pins and needles\" sensation. All three color changes are observed in classic Raynaud's. However, not all patients see all of the aforementioned color changes in all episodes, especially in milder cases of the condition. Symptoms are thought to be due to reactive hyperemias of the areas deprived of blood flow. In pregnancy, this sign normally disappears owing to increased surface blood flow. Raynaud's has also occurred in breastfeeding mothers, causing nipples to turn white and become extremely painful. Nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker and vasodilator, was recommended to increase blood flow to the extremities and noticeably relieved pain in the breast in an extremely small study group. Raynaud's disease, or \"Primary Raynaud's\", is diagnosed if the symptoms are idiopathic, that is, if they occur by themselves and not in association with other diseases. Some refer to Primary Raynaud's disease as \"being allergic to coldness\". It often develops in young women in their teens and early adulthood. Primary Raynaud's is thought to be at least partly hereditary, although specific genes have not yet been identified. Smoking increases frequency and intensity of attacks, and there is a hormonal component."}

Alopecia, or hair loss, is another key indication of GAPO syndrome. Their hair is typically thinly dispersed, and fragile, which often leads to baldness later in life. Similarly, tooth growth is stunted, with teeth failing to emerge form the gums or otherwise develop normally. Atrophy of the optic nerve occurs in approximately one third of individuals. This degradation leads to inhibited peripheral vision, and increased difficulty distinguishing colours. While not a defining feature, most sufferers of GAPO syndrome have coarse facial features, and abnormal structure of the middle portion of their faces, typically coupled with a large forehead. Individuals with the disease tend to have depressed nose bridges, protruding ears, and abnormally thick lips, though these symptoms are not unique to this disorder. No direct correlation has been found between GAPO syndrome and mental retardation, though cases of individuals having both have been reported. Due to the severity of the phenotype, GAPO syndrome can be diagnosed very early on. Most cases can be diagnosed by 6 months of age, and most symptoms will be apparent by age 2. GAPO syndrome is caused by a deletion in both copies of the ANTXR1 gene, which encodes Anthrax Toxin Receptor 1. This gene is critical for the creation of actin, and its disruption inhibits proper function of the actin network. As a result, individuals with GAPO syndrome have a buildup of extracellular matrix, and degraded cell adhesions. The alteration can occur in the form of nonsense mutations or mutations which alter the splice sites, and result in alternative RNA splicing, leading to synthesis of a different or modified protein. In humans, the ANTXR1 gene is located on Chromosome 2 and has 22 exons. GAPO syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, and requires both parents to pass on the mutant genotype. Since this mutation is so rare, most confirmed cases have a history of ancestral inbreeding. There is currently no cure for GAPO syndrome, but some options are available to reduce the symptoms. Nearsightedness, which affects some sufferers of the disease, can be treated by corrective lenses."}

Limited growth, full-body alopecia (hair loss), and a distinctive appearance (a small face with a shallow recessed jaw, and a pinched nose) are all characteristics of progeria. Signs and symptoms of this progressive disease tend to become more marked as the child ages. Later, the condition causes wrinkled skin, atherosclerosis, kidney failure, loss of eyesight, and cardiovascular problems. Scleroderma, a hardening and tightening of the skin on trunk and extremities of the body, is prevalent. People diagnosed with this disorder usually have small, fragile bodies, like those of elderly people. The face is usually wrinkled, with a larger head in relation to the body, a narrow face and a beak nose. Prominent scalp veins are noticeable (made more obvious by alopecia), as well as prominent eyes. Musculoskeletal degeneration causes loss of body fat and muscle, stiff joints, hip dislocations, and other symptoms generally absent in the non-elderly population. Individuals usually retain typical mental and motor development. In normal conditions, the LMNA gene codes for a structural protein called prelamin A which undergoes a series of processing steps before attaining its final form, called lamin A. In one of these steps, after prelamin A is made in the cytoplasm, an enzyme called farnesyl transferase attaches a farnesyl functional group to its carboxyl-terminus. The farnesylated prelamin A is then transported through a nuclear pore to the interior of the nucleus. The farnesyl group allows prelamin A to attach temporarily to the nuclear rim. Once the protein is attached, it is cleaved by a protease, thereby removing the farnesyl group along with a few adjacent amino acids. Failure to remove this farnesyl group permanently affixes the protein to the nuclear rim. After cleavage by the protease, prelamin A is referred to as lamin A. Lamin A, along with lamin B and lamin C, makes up the nuclear lamina, which provides structural support to the nucleus."}

There is evidence suggesting that hereditary haemochromatosis patients affected with other liver ailments such as hepatitis or alcoholic liver disease suffer worse liver disease than those with either condition alone. There are also juvenile forms of hereditary haemochromatosis that present in childhood with the same consequences of iron overload. Iron is stored in the liver, the pancreas and the heart. Long-term effects of haemochromatosis on these organs can be very serious, even fatal when untreated. For example, similar to alcoholism, haemochromatosis can cause cirrhosis of the liver. The liver is a primary storage area for iron and will naturally accumulate excess iron. Over time the liver is likely to be damaged by iron overload. Cirrhosis itself may lead to additional and more serious complications, including bleeding from dilated veins in the esophagus (esophageal varices) and stomach (gastric varices) and severe fluid retention in the abdomen (ascites). Toxins may accumulate in the blood and eventually affect mental functioning. This can lead to confusion or even coma (hepatic encephalopathy).

Epilepsia partialis continua is a variant involving hour-, day-, or even week-long jerking. It is a consequence of vascular disease, tumors, or encephalitis, and is drug-resistant. Generalized myoclonus is commonly seen in comatose people following CPR and is seen by some as an indication of catastrophic damage to the neocortex. Refractory status epilepticus is defined as status epilepticus that continues despite treatment with benzodiazepines and one antiepileptic drug. Super-refractory status epilepticus is defined as status epilepticus that continues or recurs 24 hours or more after the onset of anaesthetic therapy, including those cases where status epilepticus recurs on the reduction or withdrawal of anesthesia. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is a relatively long duration change in a person's level of consciousness without large scale bending and extension of the limbs due to seizure activity. It is of two main types with either prolonged complex partial seizures or absence seizures. Up to a quarter of cases of SE are nonconvulsive. In the case of complex partial status epilepticus, the seizure is confined to a small area of the brain, normally the temporal lobe. Absence status epilepticus is marked by a generalized seizure affecting the whole brain. An EEG is needed to differentiate between the two conditions. This results in episodes characterized by a long-lasting stupor, staring, and unresponsiveness. Only 25% of people who experience seizures or status epilepticus have epilepsy.

Previous definitions used a 30-minute time limit. NCSE is believed to be under-diagnosed. Benzodiazepines are the preferred initial treatment after which typically phenytoin is given."}

Arthus repeatedly injected horse serum subcutaneously into rabbits. After four injections, he found that there was edema and that the serum was absorbed slowly. Further injections eventually led to gangrene. The Arthus reaction involves the in situ formation of antigen/antibody complexes after the intradermal injection of an antigen. If the animal/patient was previously sensitized (has circulating antibody), an Arthus reaction occurs. Typical of most mechanisms of the type III hypersensitivity, Arthus manifests as local vasculitis due to deposition of IgG-based immune complexes in dermal blood vessels. Activation of complement primarily results in cleavage of soluble complement proteins forming C5a and C3a, which activate recruitment of PMNs and local mast cell degranulation (requiring the binding of the immune complex onto Fc\u03b3RIII), resulting in an inflammatory response. Further aggregation of immune complex-related processes induce a local fibrinoid necrosis with ischemia-aggravating thrombosis in the tissue vessel walls. The end result is a localized area of redness and induration that typically lasts a day or so. Arthus reactions have been infrequently reported after vaccinations containing diphtheria and tetanus toxoid. The CDC's description: Arthus reactions (type III hypersensitivity reactions) are rarely reported after vaccination and can occur after tetanus toxoid\u2013containing or diphtheria toxoid\u2013containing vaccines. An Arthus reaction is a local vasculitis associated with deposition of immune complexes and activation of complement. Immune complexes form in the setting of high local concentration of vaccine antigens and high circulating antibody concentration. Arthus reactions are characterized by severe pain, swelling, induration, edema, hemorrhage, and occasionally by necrosis. These symptoms and signs usually occur 4\u201312 hours after vaccination. ACIP has recommended that persons who experienced an Arthus reaction after a dose of tetanus toxoid\u2013containing vaccine should not receive Td more frequently than every 10 years, even for tetanus prophylaxis as part of wound management."}

Obstruction and strangulation of the hernia is rare because the underlying defect in the abdominal wall is larger than in an inguinal hernia of the newborn. The size of the base of the herniated tissue is inversely correlated with risk of strangulation (i. e. , a narrow base is more likely to strangulate). Babies are prone to this malformation because of the process during fetal development by which the abdominal organs form outside the abdominal cavity, later returning into it through an opening which will become the umbilicus. Hernias may be asymptomatic and present only as a bulge of the umbilicus. Symptoms may develop when the contracting abdominal wall causes pressure on the hernia contents. This results in abdominal pain or discomfort. These symptoms may be worsened by the patient lifting or straining. The causes of umbilical hernia are congenital and acquired malformation, but an apparent third cause is really a cause of a different type, a paraumbilical hernia. Congenital umbilical hernia is a congenital malformation of the navel (umbilicus). Among adults, it is three times more common in women than in men; among children, the ratio is roughly equal. It is also found to be more common in children of African descent. An acquired umbilical hernia directly results from increased intra-abdominal pressure caused by obesity, heavy lifting, a long history of coughing, or multiple pregnancies. Importantly, an umbilical hernia must be distinguished from a paraumbilical hernia, which occurs in adults and involves a defect in the midline near to the umbilicus, and from omphalocele. Navels with the umbilical tip protruding past the umbilical skin (\"outies\") are often mistaken for umbilical hernias, which are a completely different shape. Treatment for cosmetic purposes is not necessary, unless there are Incarceration refers to the inability to reduce the hernia back into the abdominal cavity. Prolonged incarceration can lead to tissue ischemia (strangulation) and shock when untreated. Umbilical hernias are rare."}

It is rare for symptoms to be undetected until adulthood, and usually adults have associated complications. The classic triad of intermittent abdominal pain, jaundice, and a right upper quadrant abdominal mass is found only in minority of patients. In infants, choledochal cysts usually lead to obstruction of the bile ducts and retention of bile. This leads to jaundice and an enlarged liver. If the obstruction is not relieved, permanent damage may occur to the liver - scarring and cirrhosis - with the signs of portal hypertension (obstruction to the flow of blood through the liver) and ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdomen). There is an increased risk of cancer in the wall of the cyst. In older individuals, choledochal cysts are more likely to cause abdominal pain and intermittent episodes of jaundice and occasionally cholangitis (inflammation within the bile ducts caused by the spread of bacteria from the intestine into the bile ducts). Pancreatitis also may occur. The cause of these complications may be related to either abnormal flow of bile within the ducts or the presence of gallstones They were classified into 5 types by Todani in 1977. Classification was based on site of the cyst or dilatation. Type I to IV has been subtyped. - Type I: Most common variety (80-90%) involving saccular or fusiform dilatation of a portion or entire common bile duct (CBD) with normal intrahepatic duct. - Type II: Isolated diverticulum protruding from the CBD. - Type III or Choledochocele: Arise from dilatation of duodenal portion of CBD or where pancreatic duct meets. - Type IVa: Characterized by multiple dilatations of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tree. - Type IVb: Multiple dilatations involving only the extrahepatic bile ducts. - Type V: Cystic dilatation of intrahepatic biliary ducts without extrahepatic duct disease. The presence of multiple saccular or cystic dilations of the intrahepatic ducts is known as Caroli's disease. - Type VI: An isolated cyst of the cystic duct is an extremely rare lesion."}

This allows physicians to determine certain characteristics of the plaque such as how likely it is to break away from the wall and become an embolus. MRI does not use ionizing radiation, so the number of times that it is used on a single person is not a concern; however since it uses strong electric fields those who have metal implants in cannot use this technique. - Computed tomography (CT) Multidirectional computed tomography (MDCT) is better than regular CT scans, because it can provide a higher spatial resolution and it has a shorter acquisition time. MDCT uses x-rays to obtain the image; however it can identify the composition of the plaque. Thus it can be determined whether the plaque is calcified plaque and lipid-rich plaque, so the inherent risks can be determined. Subjects are exposed to a substantial amount of radiation with this procedure, so their use is limited. Asymptomatic individuals with intracranial stenosis are typically told to take over the counter platelet inhibitors like aspirin whereas those with symptomatic presentation are prescribed anti-coagulation medications. For asymptomatic persons the idea is to stop the buildup of plaque from continuing. They are not experiencing symptoms; however if more build up occurs it is likely they will. For symptomatic individuals it is necessary to try and reduce the amount of stenosis. The anti-coagulation medications reduce the likelihood of further buildup while also trying to break down the current build up on the surface without an embolism forming. For those with severe stenosis that are at risk for impending stroke endovascular treatment is used. Depending on the individual and the location of the stenosis there are multiple treatments that can be undertaken. These include angioplasty, stent insertion, or bypass the blocked area.

The abnormal \u201chooded\u201d foreskin calls attention to the condition. However, not all newborns with partial foreskin development have hypospadias, as some have a normal urinary opening with a hooded foreskin, which is called \u201cchordee without hypospadias\u201d. Megameatus with intact prepuce variant of hypospadias occurs when the foreskin is normal and the hypospadias is concealed. The condition is discovered during newborn circumcision or later in childhood when the foreskin begins to retract. A newborn with normal-appearing foreskin and a straight penis who is discovered to have hypospadias after a circumcision was started can have circumcision completed without worry for jeopardizing future hypospadias repair. Hypospadias is almost never discovered after a circumcision. Surgery is usually recommended for hypospadias, with the goal to restore normal appearance and function to the penis. A urinary opening that is not surrounded by glans tissue is more likely to \u201cspray\u201d the urine, which can cause a man to sit to urinate because he cannot reliably stand and hit the toilet. Downward curvature of the penis can impair sexual activity as an adult. Surgery extends the urinary channel to the end of the penis, straightens bending, and corrects the foreskin abnormality by either circumcision or by repairing it to look normal (\u201cprepucioplasty\u201d), depending on the desire of care-givers. When the hypospadias is third degree (penoscrotal), or has associated birth defects such as chordee or cryptorchidism, the best management can be a more complicated decision. A karyotype and endocrine evaluation should be performed to detect intersex conditions or hormone deficiencies. If the penis is small, testosterone or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) injections may be given to enlarge it before surgery. Surgical repair of severe hypospadias may require multiple procedures and mucosal grafting. Preputial skin is often used for grafting and circumcision should be avoided before repair. In a minority of patients with severe hypospadias, surgery produces unsatisfactory results, such as scarring, curvature, or formation of urethral fistulas, diverticula, or strictures. A fistula is an unwanted opening through the skin along the course of the urethra, and can result in urinary leakage or an abnormal stream. A diverticulum is an \"outpocketing\" of the lining of the urethra which interferes with urinary flow and may result in posturination leakage."}

It is localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane. The enzyme has steroid 18-hydroxylase activity to synthesize aldosterone and other steroids. Aldosterone synthase is found within the zona glomerulosa at the outer edge of the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone synthase normally is not ACTH sensitive, and only activated by angiotensin II. Aldosterone causes the tubules of the kidneys to retain sodium and water. This increases the volume of fluid in the body, and drives up blood pressure. Steroid hormones are synthesized from cholesterol within the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone and corticosterone share the first part of their biosynthetic pathway. The last part is either mediated by the aldosterone synthase (for aldosterone) or by the 11\u03b2-hydroxylase (for corticosterone). The genes encoding aldosterone synthase and 11-hydroxylase are 95% identical and are close together on chromosome 8. In individuals with GRA, there is unequal crossing over so that the 5' regulatory region of the 11-hydroxylase gene is fused to the coding region of the aldosterone synthase. The product of this hybrid gene is aldosterone synthase that is ACTH-sensitive in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal gland. Although in normal subjects, ACTH accelerates the first step of aldosterone synthesis, ACTH normally has no effect on the activity of aldosterone synthase. However, in subjects with glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism, ACTH increases the activity of existing aldosterone synthase, resulting in an abnormally high rate of aldosterone synthesis and hyperaldosteronism. In GRA, the hypersecretion of aldosterone and the accompanying hypertension are remedied when ACTH secretion is suppressed by administering glucocorticoids. Dexamethasone, spironolactone and eplerenone have been used in treatment."}

The protein produced by the RET gene plays an important role in the TGF-beta (transforming growth factor beta) signaling system. Because the TGF-beta system operates in nervous tissues throughout the body, variations in the RET gene can have effects in nervous tissues throughout the body.

The condition is diagnosed very rarely. As the diagnosis is a lengthy differential diagnosis of exclusion there is considerable uncertainty about incidence. It has been suspected that some cases diagnosed as IGM in developing countries may have other explanations. On the other hand, IGM is usually diagnosed only after complications and referral to a secondary breast care center so light cases may resolve spontaneously or after symptomatic treatment and thus never be diagnosed as IGM. As a completely pathogen free breast will be exceedingly rare even in completely healthy population there is also uncertainty when to consider pathogens as causative or as mere coincidental finding. The cause is currently unknown. The histology is suggestive of an autoimmune reaction. The high rate of relapses as well as relatively high proportion of bilateral cases is highly suggestive of a systemic predisposition.

These are: The pathophysiology of neutropenia can be divided into congenital and acquired. In congenital neutropenia (cyclic neutropenia) is autosomal dominant, mutations in the ELA2 gene (neutrophil elastase), is the genetic reason for this condition. Acquired neutropenia (immune-associated neutropenia) is due to anti-neutrophil antibodies that work against neutrophil-specific antigens, ultimately altering neutrophil function. Neutropenia fever can complicate the treatment of cancers. Observations of pediatric patients have noted that fungal infections are more likely to develop in patients with neutropenia. Mortality increases during cancer treatments if neutropenia is also present.

Approximately 75% of Dieulafoy's lesions occur in the upper part of the stomach within 6 cm of the gastroesophageal junction, most commonly in the lesser curvature. Extragastric lesions have historically been thought to be uncommon but have been identified more frequently in recent years, likely due to increased awareness of the condition. The duodenum is the most common location (14%) followed by the colon (5%), surgical anastamoses (5%), the jejunum (1%) and the esophagus (1%). The pathology in these extragastric locations is essentially the same as that of the more common gastric lesion. In contrast to peptic ulcer disease, a history of alcohol abuse or NSAID use is usually absent in DL. Dieulafoy's lesions occur twice as often in men as women and patients typically have multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes. The symptoms due to bleeding are hematemesis and/or melena. A Dieulafoy's lesion is difficult to diagnose, because of the intermittent pattern of bleeding. Endoscopically it is not easy to recognize and therefore sometimes multiple views have to be performed over a longer period. Today angiography is a good additional diagnostic, but then it can only be seen during a bleeding at that exact time. It is diagnosed and treated endoscopically; however, endoscopic ultrasound or angiography can be of benefit. Endoscopic techniques used in the treatment include epinephrine injection followed by bipolar or monopolar electrocoagulation, injection sclerotherapy, heater probe, laser photocoagulation, hemoclipping or banding. Alternatively, in patients with refractory bleeding Interventional Radiology may be consulted for an angiogram with subselective embolization. The mortality rate for Dieulafoy's was much higher before the era of endoscopy, where open surgery was the only treatment option."}

Some are able to induce the condition in others through suggestion, in which case the term folie \u00e0 deux may be applicable. Nearly any marking upon the skin, or small object or particle found on the person or his clothing, can be interpreted as evidence for the parasitic infestation, and sufferers commonly compulsively gather such \"evidence\" and then present it to medical professionals when seeking help. This presentation of \"evidence\" is known as \"the matchbox sign\" because the \"evidence\" is frequently presented in a small container, such as a matchbox. A study conducted of 108 patients at the Mayo Clinic was published in Archives of Dermatology on May 16, 2011. The study failed to find evidence of skin infestation despite doing skin biopsies and examining specimens provided by the patients. The study, which was conducted between 2001 and 2007, concluded that the feeling of skin infestation was delusional parasitosis. Delusional parasitosis is seen more commonly in women, and the frequency is much higher past the age of 40. Delusory cleptoparasitosis is a form of delusion of parasitosis where the person believes the infestation is in their dwelling, rather than on or in their body. Morgellons is poorly understood but appears to be a form of delusional parasitosis in which people have painful skin conditions that they believe contain fibers of various kinds. Delusional parasitosis is divided into primary, secondary functional, and secondary organic groups. In primary delusional parasitosis, the delusions comprise the entire disease entity: there is no additional deterioration of basic mental functioning or idiosyncratic thought processes. The parasitic delusions consist of a single delusional belief regarding some aspect of health. This is also referred to as \"monosymptomatic hypochondriacal psychosis\", and sometimes as \"true\" delusional parasitosis. In the DSM-IV, this corresponds with \"delusional disorder, somatic type\". Secondary functional delusional parasitosis occurs when the delusions are associated with a psychiatric condition such as schizophrenia or clinical depression. Secondary organic delusional parasitosis occurs when the state of the patient is caused by a medical illness or substance (medical or recreational) use. In the DSM-IV this corresponds with \"psychotic disorder due to general medical condition\". Physical illnesses that can underlie secondary organic delusional parasitosis include: hypothyroidism, cancer, cerebrovascular disease, tuberculosis, neurological disorders, vitamin B12 deficiency, and diabetes mellitus."}

However, they have a uniform rate of recurrence and increase in grade over time so should be classified as malignant. - High-grade [WHO grade III\u2013IV] gliomas are undifferentiated or anaplastic; these are malignant and carry a worse prognosis. Of numerous grading systems in use, the most common is the World Health Organization (WHO) grading system for astrocytoma, under which tumors are graded from I (least advanced disease\u2014best prognosis) to IV (most advanced disease\u2014worst prognosis). Gliomas can be classified according to whether they are above or below a membrane in the brain called the tentorium. The tentorium separates the cerebrum (above) from the cerebellum (below). - The supratentorial is above the tentorium, in the cerebrum, and mostly found in adults (70%). - The infratentorial is below the tentorium, in the cerebellum, and mostly found in children (70%). - The pontine tumors are located in the pons of the brainstem. The brainstem has three parts (pons, midbrain, and medulla); the pons controls critical functions such as breathing, making surgery on these extremely dangerous. Symptoms of gliomas depend on which part of the central nervous system is affected. A brain glioma can cause headaches, vomiting, seizures, and cranial nerve disorders as a result of increased intracranial pressure. A glioma of the optic nerve can cause visual loss. Spinal cord gliomas can cause pain, weakness, or numbness in the extremities. Gliomas do not metastasize by the bloodstream, but they can spread via the cerebrospinal fluid and cause \"drop metastases\" to the spinal cord. A child who has a subacute disorder of the central nervous system that produces cranial nerve abnormalities (especially of cranial nerve VII and the lower bulbar nerves), long-tract signs, unsteady gait secondary to spasticity, and some behavioral changes is most likely to have a pontine glioma. The exact causes of gliomas are not known."}

Once considered uncommon, spontaneous carotid artery dissection is an increasingly recognised cause of stroke that preferentially affects the middle-aged. The incidence of spontaneous carotid artery dissection is low, and incidence rates for internal carotid artery dissection have been reported to be 2. 6 to 2. 9 per 100,000. Observational studies and case reports published since the early 1980s show that patients with spontaneous internal carotid artery dissection may also have a history of stroke in their family and/or hereditary connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, fibromuscular dysplasia, and osteogenesis imperfecta type I. IgG4-related disease involving the carotid artery has also been observed as a cause. However, although an association with connective tissue disorders does exist, most people with spontaneous arterial dissections do not have associated connective tissue disorders. Also, the reports on the prevalence of hereditary connective tissue diseases in people with spontaneous dissections are highly variable, ranging from 0% to 0. 6% in one study to 5% to 18% in another study. Internal carotid artery dissection can also be associated with an elongated styloid process (known as Eagle syndrome when the elongated styloid process causes symptoms). Carotid artery dissection is thought to be more commonly caused by severe violent trauma to the head and/or neck. An estimated 0. 67% of patients admitted to the hospital after major motor vehicle accidents were found to have blunt carotid injury, including intimal dissections, pseudoaneurysms, thromboses, or fistulas. Of these, 76% had intimal dissections, pseudoaneurysms, or a combination of the two. The probable mechanism of injury for most internal carotid injuries is rapid deceleration, with resultant hyperextension and rotation of the neck, which stretches the internal carotid artery over the upper cervical vertebrae, producing an intimal tear. After such an injury, the patient may remain asymptomatic, have a hemispheric transient ischemic event, or suffer a stroke. Arterial dissection of the carotid arteries occurs when a small tear forms in the innermost lining of the arterial wall (known as the tunica intima). Blood is then able to enter the space between the inner and outer layers of the vessel, causing narrowing (stenosis) or complete occlusion."}

Typically, the itching is localized to the palms of the hands and soles of the feet but can be anywhere on the body. Hallmarks of ICP include the following symptoms: Most common: - Itching, in particular but not limited to that of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, without presence of a rash - Itching that increases in the evening - Itching that does not respond favorably to anti-histamines or other anti-itch remedies - Often, elevated LFT results as well as serum bile acid counts Less common: - Darker urine - Lighter stools - Increased clotting time (due to possibly associated vitamin K deficiency) - Fatigue - Increased nausea - Decrease in appetite - Jaundice - Upper right quadrant pain It is important to note that not all ICP sufferers have all of the above symptoms. For example, Jaundice only occurs in relatively small subset of cases, and in some cases abnormal lab results were not seen until 15 weeks or more after the onset of symptoms. The causes of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy are still not fully understood. Hormones and genetic factors are likely to be important in the pathogenesis of the disease. A number of features of the disease suggest a link to hormones: - ICP occurs in the third trimester at the time when hormone levels are at their highest. - Twin and triplet pregnancies, which are associated with higher hormone levels, show a higher incidence of ICP. - ICP resolves quickly after delivery, when placental hormone production ceases. - Older high-dose estrogen oral contraceptive pills could cause features of ICP. Estrogens, and particularly glucuronides such as estradiol-17\u03b2-D-glucuronide, have been shown to cause cholestasis in animal studies, by reducing bile acid uptake by hepatocytes. Treatment with progesterone in the third trimester of pregnancy has been shown to be associated with the development of ICP, and levels of metabolites of progesterone, particularly sulfated progesterone, are higher in patients with ICP than unaffected women, suggesting that progesterone also has a role in ICP. Clustering of cases of ICP in families, geographic variation in rates of ICP, and recurrence of ICP in 45-70% of subsequent pregnancies all suggest a genetic component to the disease. Genetic mutations in the hepatocellular transport protein ABCB4 (MDR3), which controls secretion of phosphatidylcholine into bile, have been found in 15% of cases of ICP. Genetic mutations affecting hepatic bile salt transport molecules have also been found in patients with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC). It has been found that mothers of patients with PFIC have a higher incidence of ICP, suggesting that heterozygote carriers of these mutations are also predisposed to ICP. In addition to genetic changes to bile salt transport molecules, high levels of estrogen glucuronides have been shown to inhibit the bile salt export pump (BSEP) ABCB11, and high levels of progesterone to inhibit the ABCB4 (MDR3) phospholipid transporter. Consequently, both genetic mutations in hepatocyte proteins involved in bile secretion together with inhibition of those proteins by high levels of hormone metabolites in pregnancy may have roles in the pathogenesis of ICP. A number of features of ICP suggest that environmental factors also have a role in the disease: - It has been reported that the incidence of ICP is higher in winter than summer. - The incidence of ICP in Chile has dropped from 14% of pregnancies before 1975 to less than 2% in 1997."}

Fowl plague, however, also included Newcastle disease until as recently as the 1950s. Between 1959 and 1995, there were 15 recorded occasions of the emergence of HPAI viruses in poultry, but losses were minimal. Between 1996 and 2008 however, HPAI outbreaks in poultry have occurred at least 11 times and 4 of these outbreaks have involved millions of birds. In the 1990s, the world's poultry population grew 76% in developing countries and 23% in developed countries, contributing to the increased prevalence of avian influenza. Before the 1990s, HPAI caused high mortality in poultry, but infections were sporadic and contained. Outbreaks have become more common due to the high density and frequent movement of flocks from intensive poultry production. Influenza A/H5N1 was first isolated from a goose in China in 1996. Human infections were first reported in 1997 in Hong Kong. Since 2003, more than 700 human cases of Asian HPAI H5N1 have been reported to the WHO, primarily from 15 countries in Asia, Africa, the Pacific, Europe, and the Middle East, though over 60 countries have been affected. Genetic factors in distinguishing between \"human flu viruses\" and \"avian flu viruses\" include: There are many subtypes of avian influenza viruses, but only some strains of five subtypes have been known to infect humans: H5N1, H7N3, H7N7, H7N9, and H9N2. At least one person, an elderly woman in Jiangxi Province, China, died of pneumonia in December 2013 from the H10N8 strain, the first human fatality confirmed to be caused by that strain. Most human cases of the avian flu are a result of either handling dead infected birds or from contact with infected fluids. It can also be spread through contaminated surfaces and droppings. While most wild birds mainly have only a mild form of the H5N1 strain, once domesticated birds such as chickens or turkeys are infected, it can become much more deadly because the birds are often in close contact. There is currently a large threat of this in Asia with infected poultry due to low hygiene conditions and close quarters. Although it is easy for humans to contract the infection from birds, human-to-human transmission is more difficult without prolonged contact. However, public health officials are concerned that strains of avian flu may mutate to become easily transmissible between humans. Spreading of H5N1 from Asia to Europe is much more likely caused by both legal and illegal poultry trades than dispersing through wild bird migrations, being that in recent studies, there were no secondary rises in infection in Asia when wild birds migrate south again from their breeding grounds. Instead, the infection patterns followed transportation such as railroads, roads, and country borders, suggesting poultry trade as being much more likely."}

Some patients also have continuous tremors of various motor groups, known as myokymia. Other patients have nystagmus, vertigo, tinnitus, diplopia or seizures. The various symptoms of EA are caused by dysfunction of differing areas. Ataxia, the most common symptom, is due to misfiring of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. This is either due to direct malfunction of these cells, such as in EA2, or improper regulation of these cells, such as in EA1. Seizures are likely due to altered firing of hippocampal neurons (KCNA1 null mice have seizures for this reason). Type 1 episodic ataxia (EA1) is characterized by attacks of generalized ataxia induced by emotion or stress, with myokymia both during and between attacks. This disorder is also known as episodic ataxia with myokymia (EAM), hereditary paroxysmal ataxia with neuromyotonia and Isaacs-Mertens syndrome. Onset of EA1 occurs during early childhood to adolescence and persists throughout the patient's life. Attacks last from seconds to minutes. Mutations of the gene KCNA1, which encodes the voltage-gated potassium channel K1. 1, are responsible for this subtype of episodic ataxia. K1. 1 is expressed heavily in basket cells and interneurons that form GABAergic synapses on Purkinje cells. The channels aid in the repolarization phase of action potentials, thus affecting inhibitory input into Purkinje cells and, thereby, all motor output from the cerebellum. EA1 is an example of a synaptopathy. There are currently 17 K1. 1 mutations associated with EA1, Table 1 and Figure 1. 15 of these mutations have been at least partly characterized in cell culture based electrophysiological assays wherein 14 of these 15 mutations have demonstrated drastic alterations in channel function."}

A gynandromorph can have bilateral asymmetry\u2014one side female and one side male. Alternatively, the distribution of male and female tissue can be more haphazard. Bilateral gynandromorphy arises very early in development, typically when the organism has between 8 and 64 cells. Later stages produce a more random pattern. The cause of this phenomenon is typically, but not always, an event in mitosis during early development. While the organism contains only a few cells, one of the dividing cells does not split its sex chromosomes typically. This leads to one of the two cells having sex chromosomes that cause male development and the other cell having chromosomes that cause female development. For example, an XY cell undergoing mitosis duplicates its chromosomes, becoming XXYY. Usually this cell would divide into two XY cells, but in rare occasions the cell may divide into an X cell and an XYY cell. If this happens early in development, then a large portion of the cells are X and a large portion are XYY. Since X and XYY dictate different sexes, the organism has tissue that is female and tissue that is male. A developmental network theory of how gynandromorphs develop from a single cell based on internetwork links between parental allelic chromosomes is given in. The major types of gynandromorphs, bilateral, polar and oblique are computationally modeled. Many other possible gynandromorph combinations are computationally modeled, including predicted morphologies yet to be discovered.

The cartilage cap is covered by fibrous perichondrium and continues with the periosteum of the underlying bone. The cartilage cap is less than 2 cm thick and the thickness decreases with age. A cap more than 2 cm thick, indicates malignant transformation of a tumor. The cartilage cap merges with the epiphyseal area of the long bones called spongiosa. In the spongiosa, the chondrocytes are arranged in accordance with the epiphyseal growth plate. The spongiosa of the stalk continues with the underlying cancellous bone. Fractures within the stalk causes fibroblastic proliferation and formation of a new bone. Development of bursa takes place over the osteochondroma, which is attached to the perichondrium of the cap. Inflammation of the bone is indicated by the bursal wall lined by the synovium. As a result, patients may have swelling for years related to the location and site of the lesion indicative of mechanical obstruction, nerve impingement, pseudoaneurysm of the overlying vessel, fracture at the stalk of the lesion, or formation of bursa over the osteochondroma. Heparan sulphate (HS) are glycosaminoglycans which are involved in the formation of proteoglycans. The biosynthesis of HS takes place in the Golgi apparatus and Endoplasmic Reticulum, where glycosaminoglycans chains are maintained by type II glycosyltransferases encoded by EXOSTOSIN genes EXT1 and EXT2. Decreased levels of HS leads to mutations in EXT1 or EXT2 causing skeletal abnormality. The underlying mechanism for solitary and multiple osteochondromas have been associated with genetic alterations in EXT1 or EXT2 genes located on chromosomes 8 and 11. Approximately 65% of osteochondromas arise in the EXT1 gene loci on chromosome 8 and 35% arise in EXT2 gene loci on chromosome 11.

Patients experiencing a flare-up from Adult-onset Still's disease usually report extreme fatigue, swelling of the lymph nodes and, less commonly, fluid accumulation in the lungs and heart. In rare cases, AOSD can cause aseptic meningitis and sensorineural hearing loss. The cause of adult-onset Still's disease is unknown, but it presumably involves interleukin-1 (IL-1), since medications that block the action of IL-1\u03b2 are effective treatments. Interleukin-18 is expressed at high levels. The diagnosis is clinical, not based upon serology. At least seven sets of diagnostic criteria have been devised, however the Yamaguchi criteria have the highest sensitivity. Diagnosis requires at least five features, with at least two of these being major diagnostic criteria. People with AOSD generally experience one of two patterns in the disease: - a debilitating pattern of fevers, pain, and other systemic symptoms, or - a somewhat less aggressive pattern, in which the main symptom is arthritis and chronic joint pain. One set of 21 adult-onset Still's disease patients were divided into four types, according to clinical course patterns. These included monocyclic systemic disease, polycyclic systemic disease, chronic articular monocyclic systemic disease, and chronic articular polycyclic systemic disease. People with chronic articular disease and polyarticular disease were at higher risk to develop disabling arthritis. Adult-onset Still's disease is treated with anti-inflammatory drugs. Steroids such as prednisone are used to treat severe symptoms of Still's. Other commonly used medications include hydroxychloroquine, penicillamine, azathioprine, methotrexate, etanercept, anakinra, cyclophosphamide, adalimumab, rituximab, and infliximab. Newer drugs target interleukin-1 (IL-1), particularly IL-1\u03b2. A randomized, multicenter trial reported better outcomes in a group of 12 patients treated with anakinra than in a group of 10 patients taking other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Other anti-IL1\u03b2 drugs are being developed, including canakinumab and rilonacept. The condition \"juvenile-onset Still's disease\" is now usually grouped under juvenile rheumatoid arthritis."}

Since the vestibulocochlear nerve is in proximity to the geniculate ganglion, it may also be affected, and patients may also suffer from tinnitus, hearing loss, and vertigo. Involvement of the trigeminal nerve can cause numbness of the face. Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2 refers to shingles of the geniculate ganglion. After initial infection, varicella zoster virus lies dormant in nerve cells in the body, where it is kept in check by the immune system. Given the opportunity, for example during an illness that suppresses the immune system, the virus travels to the end of the nerve cell, where it causes the symptoms described above. The affected ganglion is responsible for the movements of facial muscles, the touch sensation of a part of ear and ear canal, the taste function of the frontal two-thirds of the tongue, and the moisturization of the eyes and the mouth. The syndrome specifically refers to the combination of this entity with weakness of the muscles activated by the facial nerve. In isolation, the latter is called Bell's Palsy. However, as with shingles, the lack of lesions does not definitely exclude the existence of a herpes infection. Even before the eruption of vesicles, varicella zoster virus can be detected from the skin of the ear. Treatment with the steroid prednisone and the antiviral drug acyclovir 800mg 5 times a day is controversial, with some studies showing to achieve complete recovery in patients if started within the first three days of facial paralysis, with chances of recovery decreasing as treatment was delayed. Delay of treatment may result in permanent facial nerve paralysis. However, some studies demonstrate that even when steroids are started promptly, only 22% of all patient achieve full recovery of facial paralysis. Treatment apparently has no effect on the recovery of hearing loss. Diazepam is sometimes used to treat the vertigo. Shingles is prevented by immunizing against the causal virus, varicella zoster, for example through Zostavax, a stronger version of chickenpox vaccine. The syndrome is named for James Ramsay Hunt, the eminent neurologist who first described it."}

In theory, X-inactivation should occur and leave only one X chromosome active in each cell. However, failure of this process has been observed in one individual studied. The reason for this is thought to be the presence of an unusually large, and imbalanced, number of X chromosomes interfering with the process."}

Symptoms include muscle wasting and weakness, muscle rigidity, developmental delays, progressive loss of vision leading to blindness, convulsions, impaired swallowing, paralysis, and dementia. Children may become comatose. Untreated, most children with this form of MLD die by age 5, often much sooner. - Children with the juvenile form of MLD (onset between 3 and 10 years of age) usually begin with impaired school performance, mental deterioration, and dementia and then develop symptoms similar to the late infantile form but with slower progression. Age of death is variable, but normally within 10 to 15 years of symptom onset although some juveniles can live for several decades or longer after onset. - The adult form commonly begins after age 16 often with an onset in the 4th or 5th decade of life and presents as a psychiatric disorder or progressive dementia. Adult-onset MLD usually progresses more slowly than the late infantile and juvenile forms, with a protracted course of a decade or more. Palliative care can help with many of the symptoms and usually improves quality of life and longevity. Carriers have low enzyme levels compared to their family population (\"normal\" levels vary from family to family) but even low enzyme levels are adequate to process the body's sulfatide. MLD is directly caused by a deficiency of the enzyme arylsulfatase A (ARSA) and is characterized by enzyme activity in leukocytes that is less than 10% of normal controls. However, assay of the ARSA enzyme activity alone is not sufficient for diagnosis; ARSA pseudodeficiency, which is characterized by enzyme activity that is 5~20% of normal controls does not cause MLD. Without this enzyme, sulfatides build up in many tissues of the body, eventually destroying the myelin sheath of the nervous system. The myelin sheath is a fatty covering that protects nerve fibers. Without it, the nerves in the brain (central nervous system \u2013 CNS) and the peripheral nerves (peripheral nervous system \u2013 PNS) which control, among other things the muscles related to mobility, cease to function properly. Arylsulfatase A is activated by saposin B (Sap B), a non-enzymatic proteinaceous cofactor. When the arylsulfatase A enzyme level is normal but the sulfatides are still high \u2013 meaning that they are not being broken down because the enzyme is not activated \u2013 the resulting disease is saposin B deficiency, which presents similar to MLD. Saposin B Deficiency is very rare, much more rare than traditional MLD. The enzyme that is present is not \"enabled\" to a normal level of efficiency and can't break down the sulfatides which results in all of the same MLD symptoms and progression."}

Most people with salmonellosis develop diarrhea, fever, vomiting, and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. Diarrhea is often mucopurulent (containing mucus or pus) and bloody. In most cases, the illness lasts four to seven days, and most people recover without treatment. In some cases, though, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient becomes dangerously dehydrated and must be taken to a hospital. At the hospital, the patient may receive intravenous fluids to treat the dehydration, and may be given medications to provide symptomatic relief, such as fever reduction. In severe cases, the Salmonella infection may spread from the intestines to the blood stream, and then to other body sites, and can cause death, unless the person is treated promptly with antibiotics. In otherwise healthy adults, the symptoms can be mild. Normally, no sepsis occurs, but it can occur exceptionally as a complication in the immunocompromised. However, in people at risk such as infants, small children, and the elderly, Salmonella infections can become very serious, leading to complications. In infants, dehydration can cause a state of severe toxicity. Extraintestinal localizations are possible, especially Salmonella meningitis in children, osteitis, etc. Children with sickle-cell anemia who are infected with Salmonella may develop osteomyelitis. Treatment of osteomyelitis, in this case, will be to use fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, etc. , and nalidixic acid). Those whose only symptom is diarrhea usually completely recover, but their bowel habits may not return to normal for several months. Typhoid fever occurs when Salmonella bacteria enter the lymphatic system and cause a systemic form of salmonellosis. Endotoxins first act on the vascular and nervous apparatus, resulting in increased permeability and decreased tone of the vessels, upset thermal regulation, vomiting, and diarrhea. In severe forms of the disease, enough liquid and electrolytes are lost to upset the water-salt metabolism, decrease the circulating blood volume and arterial pressure, and cause hypovolemic shock. Septic shock may also develop."}

The greenish black coating resembling soot or flyspeck-like dots grow into irregular stains and blotches during the summer or growing season. They can grow into each other and may cover the entire fruit surface. Frequently blotches run down in a track resembling tears (German: \"Regenfleckenkrankheit\"). The blotches can be removed by vigorous rubbing or be scratched off revealing a normal peel. Symptoms can be seen particularly well when apples are light or green colored. Late varieties are more susceptible, because the disease builds over a longer growing period. Moist and cool weather favors the infection. Orchards with shade or regions near bodies of water with frequent morning dew are especially prone to disease. Infections can occur from June until autumn. Secondary infections are caused by conidia, which are transported by wind and rain onto other developing fruit. The first visible signs of SBFS colonies appear about 3 weeks after infection. Microscopically, the flyspeck-like spots and sooty blemishes are fungal mycelium adhering to fruit. The fungi live as saprophytes on the wax layer surface of apples and do not invade the peel. The hyphae, fruiting bodies, and survival structures of these fungi become melanized over time. SBFS fungi also grow on the surfaces of stems, twigs, leaves, and fruit of a wide range of wild plants. In an 1832 paper written in Latin and published in Philadelphia, Ludwig Schweinitz described the first sooty blotch species as a fungus he named 'Dothidea pomigena'. It remained the sole species established as a cause until the beginning of the 1990s. In 1920, sooty blotch and flyspeck were mentioned together for the first time, blotch caused by Dothidea, renamed as Gloeodes pomigena and flyspeck caused by Schizothyrium pomi, respectively. Over the next 80 years various different looks of mycelia, that is morphologies were described."}

The signs and symptoms include fatigue; lightheadedness upon standing or difficulty standing, muscle weakness, fever, weight loss, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, sweating, changes in mood or personality, and joint and muscle pains. Some patients have cravings for salt or salty foods due to the loss of sodium through their urine. Hyperpigmentation of the skin may be seen, particularly when the patient lives in a sunny area, as well as darkening of the palmar crease, sites of friction, recent scars, the vermilion border of the lips, and genital skin. These skin changes are not encountered in secondary and tertiary hypoadrenalism. On physical examination, these clinical signs may be noticed: - Low blood pressure with or without orthostatic hypotension (blood pressure that decreases with standing) - Darkening (hyperpigmentation) of the skin, including areas not exposed to the sun. Characteristic sites of darkening are skin creases (e. g. , of the hands), nipple, and the inside of the cheek (buccal mucosa); also, old scars may darken. This occurs because melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) and ACTH share the same precursor molecule, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). After production in the anterior pituitary gland, POMC gets cleaved into gamma-MSH, ACTH, and beta-lipotropin. The subunit ACTH undergoes further cleavage to produce alpha-MSH, the most important MSH for skin pigmentation. In secondary and tertiary forms of adrenal insufficiency, skin darkening does not occur, as ACTH is not overproduced. Addison's disease is associated with the development of other autoimmune diseases, such as type I diabetes, thyroid disease (Hashimoto's thyroiditis), celiac disease, or vitiligo. Addison\u2019s disease may be the only manifestation of undiagnosed celiac disease. Both diseases share the same genetic risk factors (HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 haplotypes). The presence of Addison's in addition to mucocutaneous candidiasis, hypoparathyroidism, or both, is called autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1.

Persistent disease; persistent GTD: If there is any evidence of persistence of GTD, usually defined as persistent elevation of beta hCG (see \u00abDiagnosis\u00bb below), the condition may also be referred to as gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). GTD is the common name for five closely related tumours (one benign tumour, and four malignant tumours): - The benign tumour - Hydatidiform mole Here, first a fertilised egg implants into the uterus, but some cells around the fetus (the chorionic villi) do not develop properly. The pregnancy is not viable, and the normal pregnancy process turns into a benign tumour. There are two subtypes of hydatidiform mole: complete hydatidiform mole, and partial hydatidiform mole. - The four malignant tumours - Invasive mole - Choriocarcinoma - Placental site trophoblastic tumour - Epithelioid trophoblastic tumour All five closely related tumours develop in the placenta. All five tumours arise from trophoblastic cells. The trophoblast is the membrane that forms the wall of the blastocyst in the early development of the fetus. In a normal pregnancy, trophoblastic cells aid the implantation of the fertilised egg into the uterine wall. But in GTD, they develop into tumour cells. Two main risk factors increase the likelihood for the development of GTD: 1) The woman being under 20 years of age, or over 35 years of age, and 2) previous GTD. Although molar pregnancies affect women of all ages, women under 16 years of age have a six times higher risk of developing a molar pregnancy than those aged 16\u201340 years, and women 50 years of age or older have a one in three chance of having a molar pregnancy. Being from Asia/of Asian ethnicity is an important risk factor. Hydatidiform moles are abnormal conceptions with excessive placental development. Conception takes place, but placental tissue grows very fast, rather than supporting the growth of a fetus. Complete hydatidiform moles have no fetal tissue and no maternal DNA, as a result of a maternal ovum with no functional DNA. Most commonly, a single spermatozoon duplicates and fertilises an empty ovum. Less commonly, two separate spermatozoa fertilise an empty ovum (dispermic fertilisation). Partial hydatidiform moles have a fetus or fetal cells."}

The complications include rupture, peripheral embolization, acute aortic occlusion, and aortocaval (between the aorta and inferior vena cava) or aortoduodenal (between the aorta and the duodenum) fistulae. On physical examination, a palpable and pulsatile abdominal mass can be noted. Bruits can be present in case of renal or visceral arterial stenosis. The signs and symptoms of a ruptured AAA may include severe pain in the lower back, flank, abdomen or groin. A mass that pulses with the heart beat may also be felt. The bleeding can lead to a hypovolemic shock with low blood pressure and a fast heart rate. This may lead to brief passing out. The mortality of AAA rupture is as high as 90 percent. 65 to 75 percent of patients die before they arrive at the hospital and up to 90 percent die before they reach the operating room. The bleeding can be retroperitoneal or into the abdominal cavity. Rupture can also create a connection between the aorta and intestine or inferior vena cava. Flank ecchymosis (appearance of a bruise) is a sign of retroperitoneal bleeding, and is also called Grey Turner's sign. Aortic aneurysm rupture may be mistaken for the pain of kidney stones, or muscle related back pain. The exact causes of the degenerative process remain unclear. There are, however, some hypotheses and well-defined risk factors. - Tobacco smoking: More than 90% of people who develop an AAA have smoked at some point in their lives. - Alcohol and hypertension: The inflammation caused by prolonged use of alcohol and hypertensive effects from abdominal edema which leads to hemorrhoids, esophageal varices, and other conditions, is also considered a long-term cause of AAA."}

An individual may experience instability in the knee once they resume walking and other activities, and they may feel their knee is \"giving out\". Loss of full range of motion, and discomfort along the joint line are also common symptoms of an ACL injury. ACL injury is most commonly a non-contact injury that occurs when an individual stops suddenly or plants his or her foot hard into the ground (cutting). ACL injury also has been linked to heavy or stiff-legged landing; the knee rotating while landing, especially when the knee is in an unnatural position. The ACL is responsible for providing stability in knee rotation, as it prevents the tibia from shifting in front of the femur. Significantly, many ACL injuries occur in athletes landing flat on their heels. This movement directs the forces directly up the tibia into the knee, while the straight-knee position places the anterior femoral condyle on the back-slanted portion of the tibia. The resultant forward slide of the tibia relative to the femur is restrained primarily by the now-vulnerable ACL. ACL injuries also can be caused by direct contact or trauma, such as in a motor vehicle collision or from a tackle in football. A severe form of ACL injury caused by direct contact is called the \"unhappy triad,\" also known as the \"terrible triad,\" or \"O'Donaghue's triad. \" The \"unhappy triad\" involves injury of the anterior cruciate ligament, the medial collateral ligament, and the medial meniscus. Women in sports such as association football, basketball, and tennis are significantly more prone to ACL injuries than men. The discrepancy has been attributed to gender differences in anatomy, general muscular strength, reaction time of muscle contraction and coordination, and training techniques. Gender differences in ACL injury rates become evident when specific sports are compared. A review of NCAA data has found relative rates of injury per 1000 athlete exposures as follows: - Men's basketball 0. 07, women's basketball 0. 23 - Men's lacrosse 0. 12, women's lacrosse 0."}

A 2008 study compared 121 Japanese patients who experienced PONV after being given the general anesthetic propofol to 790 people who were free of post-operative nausea after receiving it. Those with a G at both copies of rs1800497 were 1. 6 times more likely to experience PONV within six hours of surgery compared to those with the AG or AA genotypes. But they were not significantly more likely to experience PONV more than six hours after surgery. Postoperative nausea and vomiting results from patient factors, surgical factors, and anesthetic factors. It has been proven that there is a direct like between length of surgery and risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Due to the length of the procedure, abdominal and laparoscopic are at a higher risk for PONV. Procedures in ENT have an increased risk as well due to the involvement of the vestibulocochlear system. In addition to the length of the surgery the dose of the anesthetic also play a large role in the risk of PONV. Patients that are female or who have a history of postoperative nausea and vomiting are at greater risk. Smokers have a decreased risk, but this would never be recommended by any physician. Older patients suffer less PONV. Obesity, age less than 16 years, past history of motion sickness and high levels of pre-operative anxiety are also risk factors for PONV. Because no currently available antiemetic is especially effective by itself, and successful control is often elusive, experts recommend a multimodal approach."}

The rash is rarely itchy for children, but can be extremely itchy for adults. Painful facial ulcers, blisters, or lesions may also develop in or around the nose or mouth. HFMD usually resolves on its own after 7\u201310 days. Most cases of the disease are relatively harmless, but complications including encephalitis, meningitis, and paralysis that mimics the neurological symptoms of polio can occur. The viruses that cause the disease are of the Picornaviridae family. Coxsackievirus A16 is the most common cause of HFMD. Enterovirus 71 (EV-71) is the second-most common cause. Many other strains of coxsackievirus and enterovirus can also be responsible. HFMD is highly contagious and is transmitted by nasopharyngeal secretions such as saliva or nasal mucus, by direct contact, or by fecal-oral transmission. Child care settings are the most common places for HMFD to be contracted because of the bathroom training, diaper changes, and that children often put their hands into their mouths. Children that do not attend a preschool or kindergarten were found to be more susceptible to the disease. HFMD is contracted through nose and throat secretions such as saliva, sputum, nasal mucus and as well as fluid in blisters, and stool. A diagnosis usually can be made by the presenting signs and symptoms alone. If the diagnosis is unclear, a throat swab or stool specimen may be taken to identify the virus by culture. The common incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from three to six days. Early detection of HFMD is important in preventing an outbreak in the pediatric population. Preventive measures include avoiding direct contact with infected individuals (including keeping infected children home from school), proper cleaning of shared utensils, disinfecting contaminated surfaces, and proper hand hygiene. These measures have been shown to be effective in decreasing the transmission of the viruses responsible for HFMD."}

Other features include excessive sweating, arthralgia and gastrointestinal abnormalities. An overview of all symptoms is provided in table 2. Table 2. Overview of symptoms Although the pathogenesis of PDP is still not fully understood, two theories have been suggested: - The neurogenic theory proposes that stimulation of the vagus nerve leads to vasodilation, increased blood flow and PDP. - The humoral theory proposes that mediators such as growth factors or inflammatory mediators are increased, leading to fibroblast proliferation and PDP. This theory is explained in the next sections. Recently, it has been suggested that the locally acting mediator prostaglandin E (PGE) plays a role in the pathogenesis of PDP. In PDP patients, high levels of PGE and decreased levels of PGE-M (the metabolite of PGE) were observed. PGE can mimic the activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts (respectively building and breaking down bone tissue). This is why acroosteolysis and periosteal bone formation can be explained by the action of PGE. Furthermore, PGE has vasodilatory effects, which is consistent with prolonged local vasodilation in digital clubbing. Elevated levels of PGE in PDP patients are associated with mutations of HPGD gene. These patients showed typical PDP symptoms such as digital clubbing and periostosis. The HPGD gene is mapped on chromosome 4q34 and encodes the enzyme HPGD (15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase). This enzyme catalyzes the first step in the degradation of PGE and related eicosanoids. So far, eight different mutations are known leading to a dysfunctional HPGD enzyme in PDP patients. Due to these mutations, the binding of the substrate PGE to HPGD is disrupted. As a result of this, PGE cannot be transferred into PGE-M down and remain present at high concentrations."}

It is unusual to notice the eruptions immediately. Symptoms can last from a few days up to two weeks, the shorter time being the norm. The reaction is identified by severe itching around small red papules 1mm to 1. 5 cm in size located on areas of skin that were covered by water-permeable clothing or hair during ocean swimming. Initial swimmer exposure to the free-floating larvae produces no effects, as each organism possesses only a single undeveloped nematocyst which is inactive while suspended in sea water. However, due to their microscopic size and sticky bodies, large concentrations of larvae can become trapped in minute gaps between skin and clothing or hair. Once the swimmer leaves the ocean, the organisms stuck against the skin die and automatically discharge their nematocysts when crushed, dried out, or exposed to fresh water. This is why symptoms usually do not appear until the swimmer dries themselves in the sun or takes a freshwater shower without first removing the affected clothing. Treatment is symptomatic. Treatment does not require a doctor's attention unless the case is severe, with most affected using a topical anti-itch cream (diphenhydramine) and a cortisone solution (hydrocortisone). Do not scratch the area, and avoid any clothing that may irritate the affected area; scratching will result in localized swelling and intense itching. Upon exiting the water, prompt removal of swim clothing (while it is still wet) followed by a warm sea-water shower largely negates the risk of Seabather's eruption even in endemic areas. A hot freshwater shower with soap (paying particular attention to the hair and areas covered by the suit) is a somewhat less-effective alternative if uncontaminated seawater is unavailable. The contaminated swimsuit should be machine washed with laundry soap and dried in warm air. Animals can be affected as well, and a cortisone solution for humans can be used on dogs. This reaction occurs mainly in the tropics and in Florida, due to the proximity of the Gulf Stream to the U. S. state. It has been identified in other locations as well."}

Therefore, in patients with COPD with significant degrees of clubbing, a search for signs of bronchogenic carcinoma (or other causes of clubbing) might be indicated. A congenital form is also known. This may be inherited either in an autosomal recessive or dominant fashion. In these cases the thumbs are almost always affected: the other fingers may be affected. A special form of clubbing is hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy, known in continental Europe as Pierre Marie-Bamberger syndrome. This is the combination of clubbing and thickening of periosteum (connective tissue lining of the bones) and synovium (lining of joints), and is often initially diagnosed as arthritis. It is commonly associated with lung cancer. Primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is HPOA without signs of pulmonary disease. This form has a hereditary component, although subtle cardiac abnormalities can occasionally be found. It is known eponymously as the Touraine\u2013Solente\u2013Gol\u00e9 syndrome. This condition has been linked to mutations in the gene on the fourth chromosome (4q33-q34) coding for the enzyme 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (HPGD); this leads to decreased breakdown of prostaglandin E2 and elevated levels of this substance. The exact cause for sporadic clubbing is unknown, with numerous theories as to its cause. Vasodilation (i. e. , distended blood vessels), secretion of growth factors (e. g. , platelet-derived growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor) from the lungs, and other mechanisms have been proposed."}

It has been shown that stress can significantly raise prolactin levels, which should make stress a diagnostic differential, though it usually is not considered such. Most pituitary tumors are sporadic \u2014 they are not genetically passed from parents to offspring. The majority of moderately raised prolactin levels (up to 5000 mIU/L) are not due to microprolactinomas but other causes. The effects of some prescription drugs are the most common. Other causes are other pituitary tumours and normal pregnancy and breastfeeding. This is discussed more under hyperprolactinaemia. The xenoestrogenic chemical Bisphenol-A has been shown to lead to hyperprolactinaemia and growth of prolactin-producing pituitary cells. The increasing and prolonged exposure of Bisphenol-A from childhood on, may contribute to the growth of a Prolactinoma. A doctor will test for prolactin blood levels in women with unexplained milk secretion (galactorrhea) or irregular menses or infertility, and in men with impaired sexual function and, in rare cases, milk secretion. If prolactin is high, a doctor will test thyroid function and ask first about other conditions and medications known to raise prolactin secretion. The doctor will also request a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is the most sensitive test for detecting pituitary tumors and determining their size. MRI scans may be repeated periodically to assess tumor progression and the effects of therapy. Computed Tomography (CT scan) also gives an image of the pituitary, but it is less sensitive than the MRI. In addition to assessing the size of the pituitary tumor, doctors also look for damage to surrounding tissues, and perform tests to assess whether production of other pituitary hormones is normal. Depending on the size of the tumor, the doctor may request an eye exam with measurement of visual fields. The goal of treatment is to return prolactin secretion to normal, reduce tumor size, correct any visual abnormalities, and restore normal pituitary function. As mentioned above, the impact of stress should be ruled out before the diagnosis of prolactinoma is given."}

Fever is not very specific, as it occurs in many other common illnesses, may be absent in those with severe disease, malnutrition or in the elderly. In addition, a cough is frequently absent in children less than 2 months old. More severe signs and symptoms in children may include blue-tinged skin, unwillingness to drink, convulsions, ongoing vomiting, extremes of temperature, or a decreased level of consciousness. Bacterial and viral cases of pneumonia usually present with similar symptoms. Some causes are associated with classic, but non-specific, clinical characteristics. Pneumonia caused by Legionella may occur with abdominal pain, diarrhea, or confusion, while pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae is associated with rusty colored sputum, and pneumonia caused by Klebsiella may have bloody sputum often described as \"currant jelly\". Bloody sputum (known as hemoptysis) may also occur with tuberculosis, Gram-negative pneumonia, and lung abscesses as well as more commonly with acute bronchitis. Mycoplasma pneumonia may occur in association with swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck, joint pain, or a middle ear infection. Viral pneumonia presents more commonly with wheezing than does bacterial pneumonia. Pneumonia was historically divided into \"typical\" and \"atypical\" based on the belief that the presentation predicted the underlying cause. However, evidence has not supported this distinction, thus it is no longer emphasized. Pneumonia is due to infections caused primarily by bacteria or viruses and less commonly by fungi and parasites. Although there are more than 100 strains of infectious agents identified, only a few are responsible for the majority of the cases. Mixed infections with both viruses and bacteria may occur in up to 45% of infections in children and 15% of infections in adults. A causative agent may not be isolated in approximately half of cases despite careful testing. The term pneumonia is sometimes more broadly applied to any condition resulting in inflammation of the lungs (caused for example by autoimmune diseases, chemical burns or drug reactions); however, this inflammation is more accurately referred to as pneumonitis. Conditions and risk factors that predispose to pneumonia include smoking, immunodeficiency, alcoholism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, chronic kidney disease, and liver disease."}

The degree of expression of the syndrome's components varies both clinically and structurally. Common symptoms that lead to diagnosis are headaches, retro-orbital pain and hemianopia. The ophthalmic features of the Bonnet\u2013Dechaume\u2013Blanc syndrome occur as retinal arteriovenous malformation (AVMs). There are three categories of AVMs that are categorized depending on the severity of the malformation. The first category consists of the patient having small lesions that usually are asymptomatic. The second category, more severe than the first, is when the patient\u2019s malformation is missing a connecting capillary. The missing capillary is meant to serve as a link between an artery and a vein; without it, edemas, hemorrhages, and visual impairments can result. Category three, the most severe, occurs when the patient\u2019s malformations are so severe that the dilated vessels cause no distinction between artery and vein. When the symptoms are this severe, the patient has a significantly increased risk of developing vision loss. Since the retinal lesions categorized vary from large vascular malformations that affect a majority of the retina to malformations that are barely visible, the lesions cause a wide range of symptoms including decrease in visual sharpness, proptosis, pupillary defects, optic degeneration and visual field defects. The most common type of visual field impairment due to AVMs is homonymous hemianopia. Homonymous hemianopia typically presents unilaterally, but bilateral cases have been reported as well. The extent of the central nervous system (CNS) features/symptoms of Bonnet\u2013Dechaume\u2013Blanc syndrome is highly dependent of the location of the cerebral AVMs and the extent of the malformation. The most common symptom affecting the CNS is an intracranial hemangioma in the midbrain. Along with hemangiomas, the malformations result in severe headaches, cerebral hemorrhages, vomiting, meningism, seizures, acute strokes or progressive neurological deficits due to acute or chronic ischaemia caused by arteriovenous shunting. The distinguishable facial features that result from Bonnet\u2013Dechaume\u2013Blanc syndrome vary from case to case. A person showing signs of the syndrome may display faint skin discoloration, nevi and angiomas of the skin. Some patients with this disorder also present with high flow arteriovenous malformations of the maxillofacial or mandibular (jaw) regions. Another facial indicator of this disease is malformations affecting the frontal and/or maxillary sinuses."}

The first is malnutrition, or, more specifically, protein deprivation. This is seen in starving children who have insufficient supplies of protein and therefore manufacture insufficient amounts of lipoproteins. They develop fatty livers: it is presumed that if they survive, cirrhosis will develop. Chronic alcoholism can cause Laennec's cirrhosis. Whether or not alcohol alone can produce fatty nutritional cirrhosis has been debated for decades. Current evidence is that it can. If so, the condition should be renamed \"alcoholic cirrhosis\". Those who do not subscribe to the \"alcohol-as-a-poison\" school state that the changes to be described are the result of malnutrition common to alcoholics. They argue that alcoholics, in a sense, are no different from those in a state of chronic protein deprivation \u2014 both have protein deprivations. Laennec's cirrhosis has three stages. The pathologic features of this form of cirrhosis change with time. Therefore, it is helpful to break the disease down into three stages: 1) the fatty liver stage, 2) the fibrotic liver stage and 3) the nodular liver stage. In early stages the liver is large and fatty. In this early stage, fat accumulates in the liver cells around the central vein (fatty change). The liver becomes large, even huge (hepatomegaly). The normal liver weighs about 1,200 grams (2. 6 lb). By comparison, fatty livers can weigh in at over 6,000 g (13 lb) and may, in the living patient, fill the abdominal cavity (remember that the normal liver extends 2-3 finger breadths below the right costal margin)."}

It includes the criterion of an increasing sense of tension before pulling the hair and gratification or relief when pulling the hair. However, some people with trichotillomania do not endorse the inclusion of \"rising tension and subsequent pleasure, gratification, or relief\" as part of the criteria; because many individuals with trichotillomania may not realize they are pulling their hair, patients presenting for diagnosis may deny the criteria for tension prior to hair pulling or a sense of gratification after hair is pulled. Trichotillomania may lie on the obsessive-compulsive spectrum, also encompassing obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), nail biting (onychophagia) and skin picking (dermatillomania), tic disorders and eating disorders. These conditions may share clinical features, genetic contributions, and possibly treatment response; however, differences between trichotillomania and OCD are present in symptoms, neural function and cognitive profile. In the sense that it is associated with irresistible urges to perform unwanted repetitive behavior, trichotillomania is akin to some of these conditions, and rates of trichotillomania among relatives of OCD patients is higher than expected by chance. However, differences between the disorder and OCD have been noted, including: differing peak ages at onset, rates of comorbidity, gender differences, and neural dysfunction and cognitive profile. When it occurs in early childhood, it can be regarded as a distinct clinical entity. Because trichotillomania can be present in multiple age groups, it is helpful in terms of prognosis and treatment to approach three distinct subgroups by age: preschool age children, preadolescents to young adults, and adults. Trichotillomania is often not a focused act, but rather hair pulling occurs in a \"trance-like\" state; hence, trichotillomania is subdivided into \"automatic\" versus \"focused\" hair pulling. Children are more often in the automatic, or unconscious, subtype and may not consciously remember pulling their hair. Other individuals may have focused, or conscious, rituals associated with hair pulling, including seeking specific types of hairs to pull, pulling until the hair feels \"just right\", or pulling in response to a specific sensation. Knowledge of the subtype is helpful in determining treatment strategies. Trichotillomania is usually confined to one or two sites, but can involve multiple sites. The scalp is the most common pulling site, followed by the eyebrows, eyelashes, face, arms, and legs. Some less common areas include the pubic area, underarms, beard, and chest. The classic presentation is the \"Friar Tuck\" form of vertex and crown alopecia. Children are less likely to pull from areas other than the scalp. People who suffer from trichotillomania often pull only one hair at a time and these hair-pulling episodes can last for hours at a time. Trichotillomania can go into remission-like states where the individual may not experience the urge to \"pull\" for days, weeks, months, and even years."}

While aniridia is rarely absent in WAGR syndrome, cases have been reported without it. Chromosomal analysis is necessary for definitive diagnosis. Other common eye defects include cataracts and ptosis. About 50% of people develop Wilms' tumour. WAGR syndrome is caused by a mutation on chromosome 11 in the 11p13 region. Specifically, several genes in this area are deleted, including the PAX6 ocular development gene and the Wilms' tumour gene (WT1). Abnormalities in WT1 may also cause genitourinary anomalies. Mutations in the PAX6 gene have recently been shown to not only cause ocular abnormalities, but also problems in the brain and pancreas. The gene for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), located on 11p14. 1, has been proposed as a candidate gene for the obesity and excessive eating in a subset of WAGR patients. This strengthens the case for a role for BDNF in energy balance. Children with WAGR syndrome receive regular (3-4 yearly) kidney surveillance for Wilms' tumour until at least the age of 6\u20138 years and thereafter remain under some follow-up because of the risk of late onset nephropathy (40% of patients over the age of 12 years).

At that time, LD was almost unknown among Brazilian physicians. The first cases were described in Brazil in 1992 in siblings from Cotia, S\u00e3o Paulo that developed symptoms as a migrating redness, general flu-like symptoms and arthritis after being bitten by ticks.

A distinct feature of the syndrome is its prolonged clinical evolution, with relapsing episodes and autoimmune dysfunction. If diagnosed in its early stages, the symptoms respond well to antibiotics. If the disease evolves to a chronic phase, it can potentially cause oligoarthritis, cognitive impairment, meningoencephalitis and erythema nodosum, with the patient risking to develop both articular and neurological sequelae. The neurological manifestations of BYS were first described by Yoshinari et al. including patients with peripheral neuritis, meningitis and cranial neuritis (facial nerve palsy, diplopia and deafness).

This hardening may affect the bones at the base of the skull or those in the hands, feet, or jaw. This causes ongoing pain and aching within the body parts that are affected. The pain has been described as either a hot electric stabbing pain, an ever-increasing pressure sensation around the bones (especially before electrical storms) or as a constant ache that radiates through several long bones at once. Pain may also occur in the hips, wrists, knees and other joints as they essentially just 'lock-up' (often becoming very stiff, immobile and sore), mostly when walking up or down staircases, writing for extended periods of time, or during the colder months of the year. Those with the disease tend to have a very characteristic walk medically diagnosed as a 'waddling gait'.

Patients may even require the use of a wheelchair (or additional carer's help with getting dressed, showering, mobility/shopping, preparing meals or lifting heavy items) especially when bedridden or housebound for days or weeks at a time. 'Flare-ups' may be attributed to, or exacerbated by growth spurts, stress, exhaustion, exercise, standing or walking for too long, illness, infection, being accidentally knocked/hurt or injured, after surgery/anaesthetics, cold weather, electrical storms, and sudden changes in barometric pressure. CED may also affect internal organs, the liver and spleen, which may become enlarged. A loss of vision and/or hearing can occur if bones are adversely affected by the hardening in the skull. Hence proactive specialist check-ups, X-rays, diagnostic tests/scans, and regular blood tests are recommended on an annual basis to monitor the CED bony growth and secondary medical issues that may arise from this condition. There are two forms: - Type 1 is associated with TGFB1 - Type 2 is not associated with TGFB1 Type 1 Camurati-Engelmann Disease is associated with an error occurring in the TGFB1 protein. Affected individuals shared a haplotype between D19S881 to D19S606. TGFB1 protein is encoded by the TGF-B1 gene, which occurs on chromosome 19q13."}

These fragments are sometimes referred to as joint mice. OCD is a type of osteochondrosis in which a lesion has formed within the cartilage layer itself, giving rise to secondary inflammation. OCD most commonly affects the knee, although it can affect other joints such as the ankle or the elbow. People with OCD report activity-related pain that develops gradually. Individual complaints usually consist of mechanical symptoms including pain, swelling, catching, locking, popping noises, and buckling / giving way; the primary presenting symptom may be a restriction in the range of movement. Symptoms typically present within the initial weeks of stage I; however, the onset of stage II occurs within months and offers little time for diagnosis. The disease progresses rapidly beyond stage II, as OCD lesions quickly move from stable cysts or fissures to unstable fragments. Non-specific symptoms, caused by similar injuries such as sprains and strains, can delay a definitive diagnosis. Physical examination typically reveals fluid in the joint, tenderness, and crepitus. The tenderness may initially spread, but often reverts to a well-defined focal point as the lesion progresses. Just as OCD shares symptoms with common maladies, acute osteochondral fracture has a similar presentation with tenderness in the affected joint, but is usually associated with a fatty hemarthrosis. Although there is no significant pathologic gait or characteristic alignment abnormality associated with OCD, the patient may walk with the involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid tibial spine impingement on the lateral aspect of the medial condyle of the femur. Despite much research, the causes remain unclear but include repetitive physical trauma, ischemia (restriction of blood flow), hereditary and endocrine factors, avascular necrosis (loss of blood flow), rapid growth, deficiencies and imbalances in the ratio of calcium to phosphorus, and problems of bone formation. Although the name \"osteochondritis\" implies inflammation, the lack of inflammatory cells in histological examination suggests a non-inflammatory cause. It is thought that repetitive microtrauma, which leads to microfractures and sometimes an interruption of blood supply to the subchondral bone, may cause subsequent localized loss of blood supply or alteration of growth. Trauma, rather than avascular necrosis, is thought to cause osteochondritis dissecans in juveniles. In adults, trauma is thought to be the main or perhaps the sole cause, and may be endogenous, exogenous or both. The incidence of repetitive strain injury in young athletes is on the rise and accounts for a significant number of visits to primary care; this reinforces the theory that OCD may be associated with increased participation in sports and subsequent trauma. High-impact sports such as gymnastics, soccer, basketball, lacrosse, football, tennis, squash, baseball and weight lifting may put participants at a higher risk of OCD in stressed joints (knees, ankles and elbows)."}

Eyelid myoclonia consists of marked jerking of the eyelids often associated with jerky upwards deviation of the eyeballs and retropulsion of the head (eyelid myoclonia without absences). This may be associated with or followed by mild impairment of consciousness (eyelid myoclonia with absences). The seizures are brief (3\u20136 s), and occur mainly and immediately after closing of the eyes (eye closure) and consistently many times a day. All patients are photosensitive. Generalised tonic-clonic seizures, either induced by lights or spontaneous, are probably inevitable in the long term and are provoked particularly by precipitating factors (sleep deprivation, alcohol) and inappropriate AED modifications. Myoclonic jerks of the limbs may occur, but are infrequent and random. Eyelid myoclonic status epilepticus, either spontaneous (mainly on awakening) or photically induced, occurs in a fifth of patients. It consists of repetitive and discontinuous episodes of eyelid myoclonia with mild absence, rather than continuous non- convulsive absence status epilepticus. Onset is typically in childhood with a peak at age 6\u20138 years (range 2\u201314 years). There is a twofold preponderance of girls. Prevalence and incidence is probably low. The most potent precipitating factor is eye closure, whether voluntary, involuntary or reflex. Most and, in some patients, all of the seizures are induced immediately after closure of the eyes in the presence of uninterrupted (non-flickering) light. Eye closure in total darkness is ineffective. Contrary to other forms of photosensitive epilepsies that are sensitive only to flickering lights, patients with Jeavons syndrome are also sensitive to bright, non-flickering lights. This is probably due to the enhancing effect of bright light on the sensitivity of eye closure. Self-induced seizures in Jeavons syndrome are rare. Eyelid myoclonia is a seizure and not an attempt for self-induced seizures. These patients do not need to produce conditions of intermittent photic stimulation for self-induction."}

Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are also likely to suffer from oligomenorrhea. PCOS is a condition in which excessive androgens (male sex hormones) are released by the ovaries. Women with PCOS show menstrual irregularities that range from oligomenorrhea and amenorrhea, to very heavy, irregular periods. The condition affects about 6% of premenopausal women. Eating disorders can result in oligomenorrhea. Although menstrual disorders are most strongly associated with Anorexia nervosa, Bulimia nervosa may also result in oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea. There is some controversy regarding the mechanism for the menstrual dysregulation, since amenorrhea may sometimes precede substantial weight loss in some anorexics. Some researchers hypothesize that some as-yet unrecognized neuroendocrine phenomenon may be involved; the menstrual irregularities may be related to the biological undergirding of the disorders, rather than a result of nutritional deficiencies."}

Currently, female fertility normally peaks at age 24 and diminishes after 30, with pregnancy occurring rarely after age 50. A female is most fertile within 24 hours of ovulation. Male fertility peaks usually at age 25 and declines after age 40. The time needed to pass (during which the couple tries to conceive) for that couple to be diagnosed with infertility differs between different jurisdictions. Existing definitions of infertility lack uniformity, rendering comparisons in prevalence between countries or over time problematic. Therefore, data estimating the prevalence of infertility cited by various sources differs significantly. A couple that tries unsuccessfully to have a child after a certain period of time (often a short period, but definitions vary) is sometimes said to be subfertile, meaning less fertile than a typical couple. Both infertility and subfertility are defined as the inability to conceive after a certain period of time (the length of which vary), so often the two terms overlap. One definition of infertility that is frequently used in the United States by reproductive endocrinologists, doctors who specialize in infertility, to consider a couple eligible for treatment is: - a woman under 35 has not conceived after 12 months of contraceptive-free intercourse. Twelve months is the lower reference limit for Time to Pregnancy (TTP) by the World Health Organization. - a woman over 35 has not conceived after 6 months of contraceptive-free sexual intercourse. These time intervals would seem to be reversed; this is an area where public policy trumps science. The idea is that for women beyond age 35, every month counts and if made to wait another 6 months to prove the necessity of medical intervention, the problem could become worse. The corollary to this is that, by definition, failure to conceive in women under 35 isn't regarded with the same urgency as it is in those over 35. In the UK, previous NICE guidelines defined infertility as failure to conceive after regular unprotected sexual intercourse for 2 years in the absence of known reproductive pathology. Updated NICE guidelines do not include a specific definition, but recommend that \"A woman of reproductive age who has not conceived after 1 year of unprotected vaginal sexual intercourse, in the absence of any known cause of infertility, should be offered further clinical assessment and investigation along with her partner, with earlier referral to a specialist if the woman is over 36 years of age. Researchers commonly base demographic studies on infertility prevalence on a five-year period. Practical measurement problems, however, exist for any definition, because it is difficult to measure continuous exposure to the risk of pregnancy over a period of years. Primary infertility is defined as the absence of a live birth for women who desire a child and have been in a union for at least 12 months, during which they have not used any contraceptives."}

Clinical symptoms may not be present until 10\u201320% of total whole-blood volume is lost. Hypovolemia can be recognized by tachycardia, diminished blood pressure, and the absence of perfusion as assessed by skin signs (skin turning pale) and/or capillary refill on forehead, lips and nail beds. The patient may feel dizzy, faint, nauseated, or very thirsty. These signs are also characteristic of most types of shock. Note that in children compensation can result in an artificially high blood pressure despite hypovolemia. Children will typically compensate (maintain blood pressure despite loss of blood volume) for a longer period than adults, but will deteriorate rapidly and severely once they do begin to decompensate. This is another reason (aside from initial lower blood volume) that even the possibility of internal bleeding in children should almost always be treated aggressively. Obvious signs of external bleeding should be noted while remembering that people can bleed to death internally without any external blood loss. (\"Blood on the floor, plus 4 more\" = intrathoracic, intraperitoneal, retroperitoneal, pelvis/thigh) There should be considered possible mechanisms of injury that may have caused internal bleeding, such as ruptured or bruised internal organs. If trained to do so and if the situation permits, there should be conducted a secondary survey and checked the chest and abdomen for pain, deformity, guarding, discoloration or swelling. Bleeding into the abdominal cavity can cause the classical bruising patterns of Grey Turner's sign or Cullen's sign. Usually referred to as a \"class\" of shock. Most sources state that there are 4 stages of hypovolemic shock; however, a number of other systems exist with as many as 6 stages.

They include land rights and ownership, diversion of land use to non productive use, increasing emphasis on export oriented agriculture, inefficient agricultural practices, war, famine, drought, over fishing, poor crop yield, etc. The basic cause of starvation is an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. In other words, the body expends more energy than it takes in. This imbalance can arise from one or more medical conditions or circumstantial situations, which can include: Medical reasons - Anorexia nervosa - Bulimia nervosa - Eating disorder, not otherwise specified - Celiac disease - Coma - Major depressive disorder - Diabetes mellitus - Digestive disease - Constant vomiting Circumstantial causes - Child/ Elder/ Dependent Abuse - Faminefor any reason, such as political strife and war - Excessive fasting - Poverty The main causes of starvation are as follows: - Economy; poor people sometimes cannot buy enough foodstuffs and thereby fail to fulfill the caloric demands of the body. - Food scarcity in the society. This causes a decreased supply of food to the whole of the population, and thus mass starvation may occur. - Diseases that can cause rapid weight loss either due to the nature of the disease or the inability of the person to either eat or eat enough due to symptoms including fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. The person may also be the host to a parasite such as an intestinal worm which may take a significant amount of the calories ingested by its host. This effect is exacerbated if the human host is already ingesting far less food than is required to meet their daily caloric intake needs. - Clinical conditions, such as recovering from surgery or burns, etc. , in which the person may be too fatigued or incapacitated to eat enough during their period of convalescence. Early symptoms include impulsivity, irritability, and hyperactivity. Atrophy (wasting away) of the stomach weakens the perception of hunger, since the perception is controlled by the percentage of the stomach that is empty. Individuals experiencing starvation lose substantial fat (adipose tissue) and muscle mass as the body breaks down these tissues for energy. Catabolysis is the process of a body breaking down its own muscles and other tissues in order to keep vital systems such as the nervous system and heart muscle (myocardium) functioning. The energy deficiency inherent in starvation causes fatigue and renders the victim more apathetic over time. As the starving person becomes too weak to move or even eat, their interaction with the surrounding world diminishes. In females, menstruation ceases when the body fat percentage is too low to support a fetus."}

This sign may at first be intermittent, occurring when a child is daydreaming, not feeling well, or tired. It may also be more noticeable when the child looks at something in the distance. Squinting or frequent rubbing of the eyes is also common with exotropia. The child probably will not mention seeing double, i. e. , double vision. However, he or she may close one eye to compensate for the problem. Generally, exotropia progresses in frequency and duration. As the disorder progresses, the eyes will start to turn out when looking at close objects as well as those in the distance. If left untreated, the eye may turn out continually, causing a loss of binocular vision. In young children with any form of strabismus, the brain may learn to ignore the misaligned eye's image and see only the image from the best-seeing eye. This is called amblyopia, or lazy eye, and results in a loss of binocular vision, impairing depth perception. In adults who develop strabismus, double vision sometimes occurs because the brain has already been trained to receive images from both eyes and cannot ignore the image from the turned eye. Additionally in adults who have had exotropia since childhood, the brain may adapt to using a \"blind-spot\" whereby it receives images from both eyes, but no full image from the deviating eye, thus avoiding double vision and in fact increasing peripheral vision on the side of the deviating eye. The causes of exotropia are not fully understood. There are six muscles that control eye movement, four that move the eye up and down and two that move it left and right. All these muscles must be coordinated and working properly in order for the brain to see a single image. When one or more of these muscles doesn't work properly, some form of strabismus may occur. Strabismus is more common in children with disorders that affect the brain such as cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, hydrocephalus, and brain tumors."}

These signs are referred to collectively as nephrotic syndrome. Minimal change disease is unique among the causes of nephrotic syndrome as it lacks evidence of pathology in light microscopy, hence the name. When albumin is excreted in the urine, its serum (blood) concentration decreases. Consequently, the intravascular oncotic pressure reduces relative to the interstitial tissue. The subsequent movement of fluid from the vascular compartment to the interstitial compartment manifests as the soft tissue swelling referred to as oedema. This fluid collects most commonly in the feet and legs, in response to gravity, particularly in those with poorly functioning valves. In severe cases, fluid can shift into the peritoneal cavity (abdomen) and cause ascites. As a result of the excess fluid, individuals with minimal change disease often gain weight, as they are excreting less water in the urine, and experience fatigue. Additionally, the protein in the urine causes it to become frothy. For years, pathologists found no changes when viewing specimens under light microscopy, hence the name \"minimal change disease. \" With the advent of electron microscopy, the changes now known as the hallmarks of the disease were discovered. These are diffuse loss of visceral epithelial cells' foot processes (i. e. , podocyte effacement), vacuolation, and growth of microvilli on the visceral epithelial cells. The cause and pathogenesis of minimal change disease is unclear and it is currently considered idiopathic. However, it does not appear to involve complement, immunoglobulins, or immune complex deposition. Rather, an altered cell-mediated immunologic response with abnormal secretion of lymphokines by T cells is thought to reduce the production of anions in the glomerular basement membrane, thereby increasing the glomerular permeability to serum albumin through a reduction of electrostatic repulsion. The loss of anionic charges is also thought to favor foot process fusion. The etiological agent is unclear but viruses such as EBV and food allergies have been implicated."}

Movements do not occur during REM because of muscle atonia. People with PLMD often do not know the cause of their excessive daytime sleepiness and their limb movements are reported by a spouse or sleep partner. PLMD is diagnosed with the aid of a polysomnogram or PSG. PLMD is diagnosed by first finding PLMS (periodic limb movements of sleep) on a PSG, then integrating that information with a detailed history from the patient and/or bed partner. PLMS can range from a small amount of movement in the ankles and toes, to wild flailing of all four limbs. These movements, which are more common in the legs than arms, occur for between 0. 5 and 5 seconds, recurring at intervals of 5 to 90 seconds. A formal diagnosis of PLMS requires three periods during the night, lasting from a few minutes to an hour or more, each containing at least 30 movements followed by partial arousal or awakening. It is mostly unknown what causes PLMD, but in many cases the patient also suffers from other medical problems such as Parkinson's disease or narcolepsy. Factors that increase the likelihood of PLMD in the absence of restless leg syndrome include being a shift worker, snoring, coffee drinking, stress, and use of hypnotics, particularly in the case of benzodiazepine withdrawal. For women, the presence of musculoskeletal disease, heart disease, obstructive sleep apnea, cataplexy, doing physical activities close to bedtime and the presence of a mental disorder were significantly associated with having a higher risk of both PLMD and restless legs syndrome. PLMD is estimated to occur in approximately 4% of adults (aged 15\u2013100), but is more common in the elderly, especially females, with up to 11% experiencing symptoms. PLMD appears to be related to restless legs syndrome (RLS) - a study of 133 people found that 80% of those with RLS also had PLMD. However the opposite is not true: many people who have PLMD do not also have restless legs syndrome. PLMD is often treated with anti-Parkinson medication; it may also respond to anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, and narcotics. Patients must stay on these medications in order to experience relief, because there is no known cure for this disorder.

If the extent of the myopia is great enough, even standard reading distances can be affected. Upon routine examination of the eyes, the vast majority of myopic eyes appear structurally identical to non-myopic eyes. In cases of high myopia, a staphyloma can sometimes be seen on fundoscopic examination. Because the most significant cause of myopia is the increase in axial length of the eye, the retina must stretch out to cover the increased surface area. As a result, the retina in myopic patients can become thin and might develop retinal holes and lattice degeneration in the periphery. High myopia increases the risk of retinal tears and detachment. A 2012 review could not find strong evidence for any cause, although many theories have been discredited. Because twins and relatives are more likely to get myopia under similar circumstances, there must be a hereditary factor. Myopic shifts seen during growth spurts of childhood and adolescence, as well as in acromegaly, indicates a relationship between the timing of myopic development and the release of human growth hormone. However, the lack of correlation between height and myopia seems to suggest the relationship between human growth hormone and myopia is complex. Myopia has been increasing rapidly throughout the developed world, suggesting environmental factors must be important. Quite similarly, the mechanisms of emmetropization are still unclear. Emmetropization is the process by which a child's eye grows and changes to become less hyperopic. It is thought that the same triggers and signals that cause this growth may also play a role in the eye growing beyond the point of emmetropia and into myopia. Normally eye development is largely genetically controlled, but it has been shown that the visual environment is an important factor in determining ocular development. Some research suggests that some cases of myopia may be inherited from one's parents. Genetically, linkage studies have identified 18 possible loci on 15 different chromosomes that are associated with myopia, but none of these loci are part of the candidate genes that cause myopia. Instead of a simple one-gene locus controlling the onset of myopia, a complex interaction of many mutated proteins acting in concert may be the cause. Instead of myopia being caused by a defect in a structural protein, defects in the control of these structural proteins might be the actual cause of myopia."}

Other signs include pelvic pain, pressure, and unusual discharge. A nonpregnant uterus that enlarges quickly is suspicious. However, none of the signs are specific. Specific screening test have not been developed; a Pap smear is a screening test for cervical cancer and not designed to detect uterine sarcoma. Investigations by the physician include imaging (ultrasound, CAT scan, MRI) and, if possible, obtaining a tissue diagnosis by biopsy, hysteroscopy, or D&C. Ultimately the diagnosis is established by the histologic examination of the specimen. Typically malignant lesions have >10 mitosis per high power field. In contrast a uterine leiomyoma as a benign lesion would have < 5 mitosis per high power field. Therapy is based on staging and patient condition and utilizes one or more of the following approaches. Surgery is the mainstay of therapy if feasible involving total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Other approaches include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy. Prognosis is relatively poor."}

LKS affects the parts of the brain that control comprehension and speech (Broca's area and Wernicke's area). The disorder usually occurs in children between the ages of 3 and 7 years. There appears to be a male dominance in the diagnosis of the syndrome (ratio of 1. 7:1, men to women). Typically, children with LKS develop normally, but then lose their language skills. While many affected individuals have clinical seizures, some only have electrographic seizures, including electrographic status epilepticus of sleep (ESES). The first indication of the language problem is usually auditory verbal agnosia. This is demonstrated in patients in multiple ways including the inability to recognize familiar noises and the impairment of the ability to lateralize or localize sound. In addition, receptive language is often critically impaired, however in some patients, impairment in expressive language is the most profound. In a study of 77 cases of Landau\u2013Kleffner syndrome, 6 were found to have this type of aphasia. Because this syndrome appears during such a critical period of language acquisition in a child's life, speech production may be affected just as severely as language comprehension. The onset of LKS is typically between 18 months and 13 years, the most predominant time of emergence being between 3 and 7 years. Generally, earlier manifestation of the disease correlates with poorer language recovery, and with the appearance of night seizures that last for longer than 36 months. LKS has a wide range of symptom differences and lacks a uniformity in diagnostic criteria between cases, and many studies don't include follow-ups on the patients, so no other relationships between symptoms and recovery have been made known. Language deterioration in patients typically occurs over a period of weeks or months. However, acute onset of the condition has also been reported as well as episodic aphasia. Seizures, especially during the night, are a heavily weighted indicator of LKS. The prevalence of clinical seizures in acquired epileptic aphasia (LKS) is 70-85%. In one third of patients, only a single episode of a seizure was recorded."}

The nerve fibers embedded in the walls of the cysts have the appearance and size of dental floss; these nerve fibers are usually not arranged in any specific alignment. Histologic examination reveals the Tarlov-cyst outer wall is composed of vascular connective tissue, and the inner wall is lined with flattened arachnoid tissue. In addition, part of the lining containing nerve fibers also occasionally contains ganglion cells. The cysts can contain anywhere from a couple of milliliters of CSF to over of CSF. Tarlov cysts are most commonly located in the S1 to S4/S5 region of the spinal canal, but can be found along any region of the spine. They usually form on the extradural components of sacrococcygeal nerve roots at the junction of dorsal root ganglion and posterior nerve roots and arise between the endoneurium and perineurium. Occasionally, these cysts are observed in the lumbar and thoracic spine. However, these cysts most commonly arise at the S2 or S3 junction of the dorsal nerve root ganglion. The cysts are often multiple, extending around the circumference of the nerve, and can enlarge over time to compress neighboring nerve roots, to cause bone erosion. The cysts may be found anterior to the sacral area and have been known to extend into the abdominal cavity. These cysts, though rare, can be found to grow large - over in size, often causing severe abdominal pain from compression on the cyst itself as well as adjoining nerves. The following table is compilation of some key differences between Tarlov cysts, meningeal cysts, and arachnoid diverticula cysts. Although the definitions for each entity are still controversial, the following items are generally accepted. Tarlov cysts are likely highly underdiagnosed as it was Isadore Tarlov's later research that led him to the understanding of their symptomology. Symptoms are based on the locations of the cysts along the spine, and follow general pathology of spinal injury: - Pain - Paresthesia - Spasticity, Hypertonia - Muscular Dysfunction or Weakness - Radiculopathy Although they are most frequently reported along sacral regions, they are rarely seen in other locations along the spine. Women are more likely to exhibit symptoms They can also appear in clusters or bilaterally along the spine, thus symptoms can be unilateral, bilateral, or with symptoms more dominant on one side. The cases of reported symptomatic Tarlov cysts ranges from 15% to 30% of the overall reported Tarlov cyst case, depending on the source of literature. Nevertheless, these cysts are important clinical entities because of their tendency to increase in size over time, potentially causing complications and eroding the surrounding bone tissue. Patients with symptomatic Tarlov cysts near the sacrum (and not other locations of the spine) can be divided into 4 categories, according to their experienced symptoms: - Group 1 - Pain on tailbones that radiates to the legs with potential weakness; - Group 2 - Pain on bones, legs, groin area, sexual dysfunctions, and dysfunctional bladder; - Group 3 - Pain that radiate from the cyst site across hips to the lower abdomen; - Group 4 - No pain, just sexual dysfunction and dysfunctional bladder."}

The size and position of the object being viewed affects the characteristics of the light entering the system. Corrective lenses affect these characteristics and are used commonly to correct refractive error. The optics of the eye including its refractive power and axial length also play a major role in retinal image size. Aniseikonia can occur naturally or be induced by the correction of a refractive error, usually anisometropia (having significantly different refractive errors between each eye) or antimetropia (being myopic (nearsighted) in one eye and hyperopic (farsighted) in the other. ) Meridional aniseikonia occurs when these refractive differences only occur in one meridian (see astigmatism). Refractive surgery can cause aniseikonia in much the same way that it is caused by glasses and contacts. One cause of significant anisometropia and subsequent aniseikonia has been aphakia. Aphakic patients do not have a crystalline lens. The crystalline lens is often removed because of opacities called cataracts. The absence of this lens left the patient highly hyperopic (farsighted) in that eye. For some patients the removal was only performed on one eye, resulting in the anisometropia / aniseikonia. Today, this is rarely a problem because when the lens is removed in cataract surgery, an intraocular lens, or IOL is left in its place. A way to demonstrate aniseikonia is to hold a near target (ex. pen or finger) approximately 6 inches directly in front of one eye. The person then closes one eye, and then the other. The person should notice that the target appears larger to the eye that it is directly in front of. When this object is viewed with both eyes, it is seen with a small amount of aniseikonia. The principles behind this demonstration are relative distance magnification (closer objects appear larger) and asymmetrical convergence (the target is not an equal distance from each eye). When this magnification difference becomes excessive the effect can cause diplopia, suppression, disorientation, eyestrain, headache, and dizziness and balance disorders."}

The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting. Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ. Acute viral hepatitis follows a pattern of infection that involves three distinct phases: 1. The initial prodromal phase (preceding symptoms) involves non-specific and flu-like symptoms common to many acute viral infections. These include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, joint pain, and headaches. Fever, when present, is most common in cases of hepatitis A and E. Late in this phase, people can experience liver-specific symptoms, including choluria (dark urine) and clay-colored stools. 2. Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes follow the prodrome after about 1\u20132 weeks and can last for up to 4 weeks. The non-specific symptoms seen in the prodromal typically resolve by this time, but people will develop an enlarged liver and right upper abdominal pain or discomfort. 10\u201320% of people will also experience an enlarged spleen, while some people will also experience a mild unintentional weight loss. 3. The recovery phase is characterized by resolution of the clinical symptoms of hepatitis with persistent elevations in liver lab values and potentially a persistently enlarged liver. All cases of hepatitis A and E are expected to fully resolve after 1\u20132 months. Most hepatitis B cases are also self-limiting and will resolve in 3\u20134 months. Few cases of hepatitis C will resolve completely. Both drug-induced hepatitis and autoimmune hepatitis can present very similarly to acute viral hepatitis, with slight variations in symptoms depending on the cause. Cases of drug-induced hepatitis can manifest with systemic signs of an allergic reaction including rash, fever, serositis (inflammation of membranes lining certain organs), elevated eosinophils (a type of white blood cell), and suppression of bone marrow activity. Fulminant hepatitis, or massive hepatic cell death, is a rare and life-threatening complication of acute hepatitis that can occur in cases of hepatitis B, D, and E, in addition to drug-induced and autoimmune hepatitis."}

In addition to other effects, histamine induces vasodilation of arterioles and constriction of bronchioles in the lungs, also known as bronchospasm. Symptoms can include mild itchiness, urticaria, angioedema, facial swelling, rhinitis, vomiting, diarrhea, acute abdominal pain, exacerbation of atopic eczema, asthma, and cardiac arrest. Anaphylaxis may occur. The cause of peanut allergy is unclear and at least 11 peanut allergens have been described. The condition is associated with several specific proteins categorized according to four common food allergy superfamilies: Cupin (Ara h 1), Prolamin (Ara h 2, 6, 7, 9), Profilim (Ara h 5), and Bet v-1-related proteins (Ara h 8). Among these peanut allergens, Ara h 1, Ara h 2, Ara h 3 and Ara h 6 are considered to be major allergens which means that they trigger an immunological response in more than 50% of the allergic population. These peanut allergens mediate an immune response via release of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody as part of the allergic reaction. Some of the peanut allergens can undergo enzymatic and non-enzymatic modifications which makes them more likely to bind to ligands on antigen-presenting cells. Ara h 1 can undergo glycosylation modifications which have been shown to induce immunomodulatory responses; it stimulates lectin receptors MR and DC-SIGN on dendritic cells which further propagate cytokines and bias the immune system towards a Th2 type response. Peanut proteins that undergo non-enzymatic changes through Maillard reactions when cooked or exposed to room temperature have an increase in AGE modifications on their structure. These changes have been shown to stimulate RAGE receptors and SR-AI/II on dendritic cells and thus lead to an increase in IL-4 and IL-5-releasing Th2 cells. Peanut allergies are uncommon in children of undeveloped countries where peanut products have been used to relieve malnutrition. The hygiene hypothesis proposes that the relatively low incidence of childhood peanut allergies in undeveloped countries is a result of exposure to diverse food sources early in life, increasing immune capability, whereas food selection by children in developed countries is more limited, reducing immune capability. A possibility of cross-reaction to soy was dismissed by an analysis finding no linkage to consumption of soy protein, and indicated that appearance of any linkage is likely due to preference to using soy milk among families with known milk allergies. When infants consume peanut proteins while 4 to 11 months old, the risk of developing peanut allergy before the age of 5 years decreases by 11-25%, specifically in children with higher allergy risk via their parents with peanut allergy. From these results, the American Academy of Pediatrics rescinded their recommendation to delay exposure to peanuts in children, also stating there is no reason to avoid peanuts during pregnancy or breastfeeding. There is conflicting evidence on whether maternal diet during pregnancy has any effect on development of allergies due to a lack of good studies. A 2010 systematic review of clinical research indicated that there is insufficient evidence for whether maternal peanut exposure, or early consumption of peanuts by children, affects sensitivity for peanut allergy. While the most obvious route for an allergic exposure is unintentional ingestion, some reactions are possible through external exposure."}

It manifests in the lower extremities and it gradually moves up towards anywhere on the body. This condition is caused by leaky blood vessels near the surface of the skin. The cause of the leaky capillaries is still unknown, but it is responsible for the discoloration of the skin. Since the blood vessels are weakened, red blood cells escape the blood vessels, where they end up near the surface of the skin. In one red blood cell, there are four heme groups and each heme group consists of one iron. Iron is responsible for helping red blood cells transfer oxygen from the lungs to the cells and carry carbon dioxide from the cells to the lungs. When red blood cells escape the blood vessels, red blood cells break apart, releasing hemoglobin. Iron is released from hemoglobin and is deposited into the skin. Since iron has no where to go and cannot be reabsorbed back into the blood, it will break apart. The iron complex hemosiderin is responsible for the discoloration of the skin, which creates patches of orange and brown pigmentation. The lesions are most frequent on the lower limbs, but may occur anywhere on the body, including the hands, arms, torso and even the neck. They may vary in number and erupt in mass numbers. They consist of irregular patches of orange or brown pigmentation with characteristic \"cayenne pepper\" spots appearing within and at the edge of old lesions. There are usually no symptoms, although there may be some slight itching, but there is no pain. The eruption may persist for many years. The pattern of the eruption changes, with slow extension and often some clearing of the original lesions. Schamberg's disease, or progressive pigmented purpuric dermatitis, is a chronic discoloration of the skin which usually affects the legs and often spreads slowly.

The disease is characterized by onycholysis and blistering of the skin in areas that receive higher levels of exposure to sunlight. The primary cause of this disorder is a deficiency of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD), a cytosolic enzyme that is a step in the enzymatic pathway that leads to the synthesis of heme. While a deficiency in this enzyme is the direct cause leading to this disorder, there are a number of both genetic and environmental risk factors that are associated with PCT. Typically, patients who are ultimately diagnosed with PCT first seek treatment following the development of photosensitivities in the form of blisters and erosions on commonly exposed areas of the skin. This is usually observed in the face, hands, forearms, and lower legs. It heals slowly and with scarring. Though blisters are the most common skin manifestations of PCT, other skin manifestations like hyperpigmentation (as if they are getting a tan) and hypertrichosis (mainly on top of the cheeks) also occur. PCT is a chronic condition, with external symptoms often subsiding and recurring as a result of a number of factors. In addition to the symptomatic manifestation of the disease in the skin, chronic liver problems are extremely common in patients with the sporadic form of PCT. These include hepatic fibrosis (scarring of the liver), cirrhosis, and inflammation. However, liver problems are less common in patients with the inherited form of the disease. Additionally, patients will often void a wine-red color urine with an increased concentration of uroporphyrin I due to their enzymatic deficiency. Certain vitamin and minerals deficiencies are commonly found in people with porphyria cutanea tarda. The most frequently cited deficiencies are those of beta-Carotene, retinol, vitamin A and vitamin C. Beta-Carotene is required to synthesize vitamin A and vitamin A is needed to synthesize retinol. A lack of retinol-binding protein is due to a lack of retinol which is required to trigger its production. The damaging effects of porphyrins interacting with iron, absorbing photons to then emit reactive oxygen species is the mechanism of action that results in the itchy, painful blisters that are common with PCT. The reactive oxygen species that are formed interact with and exhaust the antioxidants in the skin, primarily those of beta-Carotene, vitamin E, and vitamin C. Supplementation of these three vitamins has been shown to decrease these oxidative effects and potentially diminish the severity of blister formation."}

In basic and advanced life support airway obstructions are often referred to as A-problems. Management of airways relies on both minimal-invasive and invasive techniques. Lower airway obstruction is mainly caused by increased resistance in the bronchioles (usually from a decreased radius of the bronchioles) that reduces the amount of air inhaled in each breath and the oxygen that reaches the pulmonary arteries. It is different from airway restriction (which prevents air from diffusing into the pulmonary arteries because of some kind of blockage in the lungs). Diseases that cause lower airway obstruction are termed obstructive lung diseases. Lower airway obstruction can be measured using spirometry. A decreased FEV1/FVC ratio (versus the normal of about 80%) is indicative of an airway obstruction, as the normal amount of air can no longer be exhaled in the first second of expiration. An airway restriction would not produce a reduced FEV1/FVC ratio, but would reduce the vital capacity. The ventilation is therefore affected leading to a ventilation perfusion mismatch and hypoxia. Airway obstruction may cause obstructive pneumonitis or post-obstructive pneumonitis."}

The akinetopsia often occurs with visual trailing (palinopsia), with afterimages being left at each frame of the motion. It is caused by prescription drugs, hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD), and persistent aura without infarction. The pathophysiology of akinetopsia palinopsia is not known, but it has been hypothesized to be due to inappropriate activation of physiological motion suppression mechanisms which are normally used to maintain visual stability during eye movements (e. g. saccadic suppression). Gross akinetopsia is an extremely rare condition. Patients have profound motion blindness and struggle in performing the activities of daily living. Instead of seeing vision as a cinema reel, these patients have trouble perceiving gross motion. Most of what is known about this extremely rare condition was learned through the case study of one patient, LM. LM described pouring a cup of tea or coffee difficult \"because the fluid appeared to be frozen, like a glacier\". She did not know when to stop pouring, because she could not perceive the movement of the fluid rising. LM and other patients have also complained of having trouble following conversations, because lip movements and changing facial expressions were missed. LM stated she felt insecure when more than two people were walking around in a room: \"people were suddenly here or there but I have not seen them moving\". Movement is inferred by comparing the change in position of an object or person. LM and others have described crossing the street and driving cars to also be of great difficulty. LM started to train her hearing to estimate distance. A change in brain structure (typically lesions) disturbs the psychological process of understanding sensory information, in this case visual information."}

Most are inherited as autosomal recessive diseases. Organic acidemias are usually diagnosed in infancy, characterized by urinary excretion of abnormal amounts or types of organic acids. The diagnosis is usually made by detecting an abnormal pattern of organic acids in a urine sample by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In some conditions, the urine is always abnormal, in others the characteristic substances are only present intermittently. Many of the organic acidemias are detectable by newborn screening with tandem mass spectrometry. These disorders vary in their prognosis, from manageable to fatal, and usually affect more than one organ system, especially the central nervous system. Neurological damage and developmental delay are common factors in diagnosis, with associated symptoms ranging from poor feeding to slow growth, lethargy, vomiting, dehydration, malnutrition, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, metabolic acidosis, ketoacidosis, hyperammonemia, and if left untreated, death. Treatment or management of organic acidemias vary; eg see methylmalonic acidemia, propionic acidemia, isovaleric acidemia, and maple syrup urine disease. As of 1984 there were no effective treatments for all of the conditions, though treatment for some included a limited protein/high carbohydrate diet, intravenous fluids, amino acid substitution, vitamin supplementation, carnitine, induced anabolism, and in some cases, tube-feeding. As of 1993 ketothiolase deficiency and other OAs were managed by trying to restore biochemical and physiologic homeostasis; common therapies included restricting diet to avoid the precursor amino acids and use of compounds to either dispose of toxic metabolites or increase enzyme activity."}

The blepharospasm referred to here is officially called benign essential blepharospasm (BEB) to distinguish it from the less serious secondary blinking disorders. \"Benign\" indicates the condition is not life-threatening, and \"essential\" is a medical term meaning \"of unknown cause\". It is both a cranial and a focal dystonia. Cranial refers to the head and focal indicates confinement to one part. The word dystonia describes abnormal involuntary sustained muscle contractions and spasms. Patients with blepharospasm have normal eyes. The visual disturbance is due solely to the forced closure of the eyelids. Oromandibular dystonia (OMD) is a form of focal dystonia that affects varying areas of the head and neck including the lower face, jaw, tongue and larynx. The spasms may cause the mouth to pull open, shut tight, or move repetitively. Speech and swallowing may be distorted. It is often associated with dystonia of the cervical muscles (Spasmodic Torticollis), eyelids (Blepharospasm), or larynx (Spasmodic Dysphonia). In patients with OMD, involuntary contractions may involve the muscles used for chewing (masticatory muscles). These may include the thick muscle in the cheek that closes the jaw (masseter muscle) and the broad muscle that draws back the lower jaw and closes the mouth (temporalis muscle).

Many also report a number of subjective symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, bone pain and insomnia. Crampy abdominal pain may occur. Physical examination of someone with hypocalcemia may show tetany, but it is also possible to provoke tetany of the facial muscles by tapping on the facial nerve (a phenomenon known as Chvostek's sign) or by using the cuff of a sphygmomanometer to temporarily obstruct the blood flow to the arm (a phenomenon known as Trousseau's sign of latent tetany). A number of medical emergencies can arise in people with low calcium levels. These are seizures, severe irregularities in the normal heart beat, as well as spasm of the upper part of the airways or the smaller airways known as the bronchi (both potentially causing respiratory failure). Hypoparathyroidism can have the following causes: - Removal of, or trauma to, the parathyroid glands due to thyroid surgery (thyroidectomy), parathyroid surgery (parathyroidectomy) or other surgical interventions in the central part of the neck (such as operations on the larynx and/or pharynx) is a recognized cause. It is the most common cause of hypoparathyroidism. Although surgeons generally make attempts to spare normal parathyroid glands at surgery, inadvertent injury to the glands or their blood supply is still common. When this happens, the parathyroids may cease functioning. This is usually temporary but occasionally long term (permanent). - Kenny-Caffey Syndrome - Autoimmune invasion and destruction is the most common non-surgical cause. It can occur as part of autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes. - Hemochromatosis can lead to iron accumulation and consequent dysfunction of a number of endocrine organs, including the parathyroids. - Absence or dysfunction of the parathyroid glands is one of the components of chromosome 22q11 microdeletion syndrome (other names: DiGeorge syndrome, Schprintzen syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome). - Magnesium deficiency - A defect in the calcium receptor leads to a rare congenital form of the disease - Idiopathic (of unknown cause), occasionally familial (e. g. Barakat syndrome (HDR syndrome) a genetic development disorder resulting in hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness and renal disease) The parathyroid glands are so named because they are usually located behind the thyroid gland in the neck. They arise during fetal development from structures known as the third and fourth pharyngeal pouch."}

These may be accompanied by more general symptoms such as loss of appetite, weight loss and weakness. Most mucosal squamous cell head and neck cancers, including oropharyngeal cancer (OPC), have historically been attributed to tobacco and alcohol use. However this pattern has changed considerably since the 1980s. It was realised that some cancers occur in the absence of these risk factors and an association between human papilloma virus (HPV) and various squamous cell cancers, including OPC, was first described in 1983. Since then both molecular and epidemiological evidence has been accumulating, with the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) stating that high-risk HPV types 16 and 18 are carcinogenic in humans, in 1995, and In 2007 that HPV was a cause for oral cancers. Human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive cancer (HPV+OPC) incidence has been increasing while HPV-negative (HPV-OPC) cancer incidence is declining, a trend that is estimated to increase further in coming years. Since there are marked differences in clinical presentation and treatment relative to HPV status, HPV+OPC is now viewed as a distinct biologic and clinical condition. Human HPV has long been implicated in the pathogenesis of several anogenital cancers including those of the anus, vulva, vagina, cervix, and penis. In 2007 it was also implicated by both molecular and epidemiological evidence in cancers arising outside of the anogenital tract, namely oral cancers. HPV infection is common among healthy individuals, and is acquired largely through sexual contact. Although less data is available, prevalence of HPV infection is at least as common among men as among women, with 2004 estimates of about 27% among US women aged 14\u201359. HPV oral infection precedes the development of HPV+OPC. Slight injuries in the mucous membrane serve as an entry gate for HPV, which thus works into the basal layer of the epithelium. People testing positive for HPV type 16 virus (HPV16) oral infection have a 14 times increased risk of developing HPV+OPC. Immunosuppression seems to be an increased risk factor for HPV+OPC. Individuals with TGF-\u03b21 genetic variations, specially T869C, are more likely to have HPV16+OPC. TGF-\u03b21 plays an important role in controlling the immune system. In 1993 it was noted that patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated anogenital cancers had a 4-fold increased risk of tonsillar squamous-cell carcinoma. Although evidence suggests that HPV16 is the main cause of OPC in humans not exposed to smoking and alcohol, the degree to which tobacco and/or alcohol use may contribute to increase the risk of HPV+OPC has not always been clear but it appears that both smoking and HPV infection are independent and additive risk factors for developing OPC."}

The bleeding tendency is variable but may be severe. Hemarthrosis, particularly spontaneous, is very rare, in contrast to the hemophilias. Platelet numbers and morphology are normal. Platelet aggregation is normal with ristocetin, but impaired with other agonists such as ADP, thrombin, collagen or epinephrine. Glanzmann's thrombasthenia can be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner or acquired as an autoimmune disorder. The bleeding tendency in Glanzmann's thrombasthenia is variable, some individuals having minimal bruising, while others have frequent, severe, potentially fatal hemorrhages. Moreover, platelet \u03b1\u03b2 levels correlate poorly with hemorrhagic severity, as virtually undetectable \u03b1\u03b2 levels can correlate with negligible bleeding symptoms, and 10%\u201315% levels can correlate with severe hemorrhage. Unidentified factors other than the platelet defect itself may have important roles. Glanzmann's thrombasthenia is associated with abnormal integrin \u03b1\u03b2, formerly known as glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GpIIb/IIIa), which is an integrin aggregation receptor on platelets. This receptor is activated when the platelet is stimulated by ADP, epinephrine, collagen, or thrombin. GpIIb/IIIa is essential to blood coagulation since the activated receptor has the ability to bind fibrinogen (as well as von Willebrand factor, fibronectin, and vitronectin), which is required for fibrinogen-dependent platelet-platelet interaction (aggregation). In contrast, glycoproteinIb receptors are normal with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. The role of GpIb is to enable platelet activation by contact with the von Willebrand factor-collagen complex that is exposed when the endothelial blood vessel lining is damaged. GpIb receptors are deficient in a disease known as Bernard\u2013Soulier syndrome. Understanding of the role of GpIIb/IIIa in Glanzmann's thrombasthenia led to the development of GpIIb/IIIa inhibitors, a class of powerful antiplatelet agents. Therapy involves both preventive measures and treatment of specific bleeding episodes. - Dental hygiene lessens gingival bleeding - Avoidance of antiplatelet agents such as aspirin and other anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and naproxen, and anticoagulants - Iron or folate supplementation may be necessary if excessive or prolonged bleeding has caused anemia - Hepatitis B vaccine - Antifibrinolytic drugs such as tranexamic acid or \u03b5-aminocaproic acid (Amicar) - Desmopressin (DDAVP) does not normalize the bleeding time in Glanzmann's thrombasthenia but anecdotally improves hemostasis - Hormonal contraceptives to control excessive menstrual bleeding - Topical agents such as gelfoam, fibrin sealants, polyethylene glycol polymers, custom dental splints - Platelet transfusions (only if bleeding is severe; risk of platelet alloimmunization) - Recombinant factor VIIa, AryoSeven or NovoSeven FDA approved this drug for the treatment of the disease on July 2014. - Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for severe recurrent hemorrhages It is named after Eduard Glanzmann (1887-1959), the Swiss pediatrician who originally described it."}

Apart from the appearance, the condition is typically asymptomatic, but sometimes people may experience a gagging sensation or a bad taste. There may also be associated oral malodor (intra-oral halitosis). The cause is uncertain, but it is thought to be caused by accumulation of epithelial squames and proliferation of chromogenic (i. e. , color-producing) microorganisms. There may be an increase in keratin production or a decrease in normal desquamation (shedding of surface epithelial cells). Many people with BHT are heavy smokers. Other possible associated factors are poor oral hygiene, general debilitation, hyposalivation (i. e. , decreased salivary flow rate), radiotherapy, overgrowth of fungal or bacterial organisms, and a soft diet. Occasionally, BHT may be caused by the use of antimicrobial medications (e. g. , tetracyclines), or oxidizing mouthwashes or antacids.

After it is determined that EDS is present, a complete medical examination and full evaluation of potential disorders in the differential diagnosis (which can be tedious, expensive and time-consuming) should be undertaken. Hypersomnia can be primary (of central/brain origin), or it can be secondary to any of numerous medical conditions. More than one type of hypersomnia can coexist in a single patient. Even in the presence of a known cause of hypersomnia, the contribution of this cause to the complaint of EDS needs to be assessed. When specific treatments of the known condition do not fully suppress EDS, additional causes of hypersomnia should be sought. For example, if a patient with sleep apnea is treated with CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) which resolves their apneas but not their EDS, it is necessary to seek other causes for the EDS. Obstructive sleep apnea \u201coccurs frequently in narcolepsy and may delay the diagnosis of narcolepsy by several years and interfere with its proper management. \u201d The true primary hypersomnias include these: narcolepsy (with and without cataplexy); idiopathic hypersomnia; and recurrent hypersomnias (like Klein-Levin syndrome). There are also several genetic disorders that may be associated with primary/central hypersomnia. These include the following: Prader-Willi syndrome; Norrie disease; Niemann\u2013Pick disease, type C; and myotonic dystrophy. However, hypersomnia in these syndromes may also be associated with other secondary causes, so it is important to complete a full evaluation. Interestingly, myotonic dystrophy is often associated with SOREMPs (sleep onset REM periods, such as occur in narcolepsy). There are many neurological disorders that may mimic the primary hypersomnias, narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia: brain tumors; stroke-provoking lesions; and dysfunction in the thalamus, hypothalamus, or brainstem. Also, neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or multiple system atrophy are frequently associated with primary hypersomnia. However, in these cases, one must still rule out other secondary causes. Early hydrocephalus can also cause severe EDS."}

The classic descriptions of LAD included recurrent bacterial infections, defects in neutrophil adhesion, and a delay in umbilical cord sloughing. The adhesion defects result in poor leukocyte chemotaxis, particularly neutrophil, inability to form pus and neutrophilia. Individuals with LAD suffer from bacterial infections beginning in the neonatal period. Infections such as omphalitis, pneumonia, gingivitis, and peritonitis are common and often life-threatening due to the infant's inability to properly destroy the invading pathogens. These individuals do not form abscesses because granulocytes cannot migrate to the sites of infection. Types of leukocyte adhesion deficiency include LAD1, LAD2, and LAD3. LAD1 is the most common. Patients with LAD1 have an inherited molecular defect that causes a deficiency of the \u03b2-2 integrin subunit, also called CD18, which is encoded by the ITGB2 gene found on chromosome 21. This subunit is involved in the formation of the \u03b2-2 integrins (LFA-1, Integrin alphaXbeta2, and Mac-1/CR3) by dimerization with different CD11 subunits. Mutations in the ITGB2 gene lead to absent, reduced, or aberrant CD18 protein expression, causing a lack of expression in the leukocyte membrane of the \u03b2-2 integrins. The main function of these proteins is to allow neutrophils to make their way out of the blood stream to the infected tissues by adhering to different ligands expressed by the endothelium, e. g. ICAM-1. In LAD-I patients, neutrophils cannot extravasate and fight against bacteria in tissues. The bacteria can then proliferate, leading to symptomatic infection, which can spread unimpeded and cause serious injury to important tissues. Typically, diagnosis involves several preliminary tests of immune function, including basic evaluation of the humoral immune system and the cell-mediated immune system. A WBC differential will reveal extremely elevated levels of neutrophils (on the order of 6-10x normal) because they are unable to leave the blood vessels. In the case of LAD-I, specific diagnosis is done by flow cytometry. This technique will reveal absent or reduced CD18 expression in the leukocyte membrane."}

Other crosslinks include the formation of an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone via aldol condensation and hydroxylysinonorleucine.

Most common initial symptoms of Sheehan's syndrome are agalactorrhea (absence of lactation) and/or difficulties with lactation. Many women also report amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after delivery. In some cases, a woman with Sheehan syndrome might be relatively asymptomatic, and the diagnosis is not made until years later, with features of hypopituitarism. Such features include secondary hypothyroidism with tiredness, intolerance to cold, constipation, weight gain, hair loss and slowed thinking, as well as a slowed heart rate and low blood pressure. Another such feature is secondary adrenal insufficiency, which, in the rather chronic case is similar to Addison's disease with symptoms including fatigue, weight loss, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels), anemia and hyponatremia (low sodium levels). Such a woman may, however, become acutely exacerbated when her body is stressed by, for example, a severe infection or surgery years after her delivery, a condition equivalent with an Addisonian crisis. The symptoms of adrenal crisis should be treated immediately and can be life-threatening. Gonadotropin deficiency will often cause amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, hot flashes, or decreased libido. Growth hormone deficiency causes many vague symptoms including fatigue and decreased muscle mass. Uncommonly, Sheehan syndrome may also appear acutely after delivery, mainly by hyponatremia. There are several possible mechanisms by which hypopituitarism can result in hyponatremia, including decreased free-water clearance by hypothyroidism, direct syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) hypersecretion, decreased free-water clearance by glucocorticoid deficiency (independent of ADH). The potassium level in these situations is normal, because adrenal production of aldosterone is not dependent on the pituitary. In the developed world it is a rare complication of pregnancy, usually occurring after excessive blood loss.

If chronic, cheilitis simplex can progress to crusting and bleeding. Lip licking, biting, or rubbing habits are frequently involved. Paradoxically, constant licking of the lips causes drying and irritation, and eventually the mucosa splits or cracks. The lips have a greater tendency to dry out in cold, dry weather. Digestive enzymes present in saliva may also irritate the lips, and the evaporation of the water in saliva saps moisture from them. Some children have a habit of sucking and chewing on the lower lip, producing a combination of cheilitis and sharply demarcated perioral erythema (redness). Treatment is usually successful with barrier lubricants, such as lip salve or Vaseline. Medical grade (USP) lanolin accelerates repair of the lips, and is used in some lip repair products. Sometimes the term \"cheilitis simplex\" is used as a synonym for cheilitis generally, however, exfoliative cheilitis (discussed later) is also sometimes stated to be the equivalent of chapped lips.

Mild jaundice may appear under conditions of exertion, stress, fasting, and infections, but the condition is otherwise usually asymptomatic. Severe cases are seen by yellowing of the skin tone and yellowing of the sclera in the eye. GS has been reported to possibly contribute to an accelerated onset of neonatal jaundice, especially in the presence of increased red blood cell destruction due to diseases such as G6PD deficiency. This situation can be especially dangerous if not quickly treated, as the high bilirubin causes irreversible neurological disability in the form of kernicterus. The enzymes that are defective in GS - UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1 (UGT1A1) - are also responsible for some of the liver's ability to detoxify certain drugs. For example, Gilbert's syndrome is associated with severe diarrhea and neutropenia in patients who are treated with irinotecan, which is metabolized by UGT1A1. While paracetamol (acetaminophen) is not metabolized by UGT1A1, it is metabolized by one of the other enzymes also deficient in some people with GS. A subset of people with GS may have an increased risk of paracetamol toxicity. Several analyses have found a significantly decreased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in individuals with GS. Specifically, people with mildly elevated levels of bilirubin (1. 1 mg/dl to 2. 7 mg/dl) were at lower risk for CAD and at lower risk for future heart disease. These researchers went on to perform a meta-analysis of data available up to 2002, and confirmed the incidence of atherosclerotic disease (hardening of the arteries) in subjects with GS had a close and inverse relationship to the serum bilirubin. This beneficial effect was attributed to bilirubin IX\u03b1 which is recognized as a potent antioxidant, rather than confounding factors such as high-density lipoprotein levels. This association was also seen in long-term data from the Framingham Heart Study. Moderately elevated levels of bilirubin in people with GS and the (TA)/(TA) genotype were associated with one-third the risk for both coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease as compared to those with the (TA)/(TA) genotype (i. e. a normal, nonmutated gene locus).

Characteristics of this syndrome include absence or poor development of the area connecting the left and right parts of the brain, an abnormally large head, increased distance between facial features (eyes), poor motor skills, mental retardation [2], extra fingers and toes, many facial deformities [3], and cleft palate [5]. This is considered a rare disorder and is placed on the NIH Office of Rare Diseases (fewer than 200,000 cases) rare disease list [8]. Lifespan may range from stillbirth to normal expectancy depending on pregnancy complications and severity of the disorder [2,3,5]. In mild cases, the subjects have been shown to live relatively normal lives, but with developmental delays [2]. Acrocallosal syndrome (ACLS, ACS, Schinzel-Type) is a rare, heterogeneous, autosomal recessive disorder [3]. The heterogeneity of this condition refers to the multiple genes that may function to contribute to varying degrees of this syndrome [3] and is often linked to consanguinity [2,5]. Characteristics of this syndrome include agenesis of the corpus, macrocephaly, hypertelorism, polydactyly, mental and motor retardation [2], craniofacial dysmorphism, hallux dudplication [3], and sometimes palatal clefting [5]. It has also been reported that there are many similar signs and symptoms between ACLS, Greig cephalopolysyndactyly, and Hydrolethalus Syndrome (HLS), although there is little evidence to support common genetic causation at this point [3]. Recent studies by Putoux et al. , (2011), have indicated that the mutations responsible for ACLS are located in the KIF7 protein. KIF7 is a 1343 amino acid protein with a kinesin motor, coiled coil, and Gli-binding domains [3,5]. Its functions are largely associated with ciliary motor function [3] and is a key factor in the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) transduction pathways [4,5] that are crucial during embryogenesis [7]. Therefore, mutations in Hedgehog signaling components (KIF7) may lead to cilia based pathologies and ultimately defects in the brain and other areas associated with ACLS and related disorders [5]. More specifically, mutations observed by Elson et al. , (2002), in the GLI3 gene have yielded similar characteristics to ACLS, but further evidence is needed since the corpus callosum is usually present in these cases. Other studies have also indicated that KIF7 interacts with Gli transcription factors, so mutations in the KIF7 gene may be upstream effectors of GLI3 [6]. Further understanding about the functionality of ACLS and its underlying mechanisms opens new doors to pharmacological manipulation and other forms of molecular therapy."}

People with bulimia nervosa may also exercise to a point that excludes other activities. With regards to interoception, people with bulimia report reduced sensitivity to many kinds of internal and external sensations. For example, some show increased thresholds to heat pain compared and report the same level of satiety after consuming more calories than do healthy subjects. Bulimics are much more likely than non-bulimics to have an affective disorder, such as depression or general anxiety disorder: A 1985 Columbia University study on female bulimics at New York State Psychiatric Institute found 70% had suffered depression some time in their lives (as opposed to 25. 8% for adult females in a control sample from the general population), rising to 88% for all affective disorders combined. Another study by the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne on a cohort of 2,000 adolescents similarly found that those meeting at least two of the DSM-IV criteria for bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa had a sixfold increase in risk of anxiety and a doubled risk for substance dependency. Some sufferers of anorexia nervosa exhibit episodes of bulimic tendencies through purging (either through self-induced vomiting or laxatives) as a way to quickly remove food in their system. Bulimia also has negative effects on the sufferer's dental health due to the acid passed through the mouth from frequent vomiting causing acid erosion, mainly on the posterior dental surface. The onset of bulimia nervosa is often during adolescence, between 13 and 20 years of age, and many cases have previously suffered from obesity, with many sufferers relapsing in adulthood into episodic bingeing and purging even after initially successful treatment and remission. A lifetime prevalence of 0. 5 percent and 0. 9 percent for adult and adolescent sufferers, respectively, is estimated among the United States population. Bulimia nervosa may affect up to 1% of young women and, after 10 years of diagnosis, half will recover fully, a third will recover partially, and 10\u201320% will still have symptoms. Adolescents with bulimia nervosa are more likely to have self-imposed perfectionism and compulsivity issues in eating compared to their peers. This means that the high expectations and unrealistic goals that these individuals set for themselves are internally motivated rather than by social views or expectations. Bulimia nervosa can be difficult to detect, compared to anorexia nervosa, because bulimics tend to be of average or slightly above or below average weight. Many bulimics may also engage in significantly disordered eating and exercise patterns without meeting the full diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa. Recently, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders was revised, which resulted in the loosening of criteria regarding the diagnoses of bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa."}

This is the alleged cause of the physical abnormalities and symptoms associated with otodental syndrome. Although in individuals with signs of ocular coloboma, a microdeletion in the Fas-associated death domain (FADD) gene (11q13. 3) was also found to be responsible. There is variable penetrance and variable gene expression within these genetic mutations. Individuals with sensorineural hearing loss are believed to have a local lesion in the auditory segment of the inner ear, known as the cochlea. The biological mechanism for this is currently unknown as well. Symptoms of otodental syndrome can and usually appear in early development and progress with age. Although the specific frequency of the symptoms is not known, the duration is recognized to be for life; assuming no treatment has been undergone. The symptoms are variable to each individual, can range greatly in severity and are dependent on gene expression. More severe symptoms include: - Globodontia \u2013 an abnormal condition that can occur in both primary and secondary tooth development, in which the molars and canines are greatly enlarged. It refers to the enlarged bulbous fused malformed posterior teeth with almost no discernible cusps or grooves. The molars are known to have a rounded globe-like shape. Can attribute to pain. - Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) \u2013 also known as nerve related hearing loss, is a form of hearing loss associated with complications within the inner ear. - Taurodontism \u2013 known as a condition in which the body of a tooth is enlarged at the expense of the roots. This results in an enlarged pulp chamber, lack of proper bonding at the cementoenamel junction, and can cause the pulpal floor to be displaced towards the root. Discomfort and pain are usually associated with these characteristics. - Endodontic-Periodontic lesions \u2013 oral lesions that can potentially form into abscesses."}

Acid-base disturbances such as lactic acidosis are typically first assessed using arterial blood gas tests. Testing of venous blood is also available as an alternative.

First, glucose is broken down to pyruvate through glycolysis. Then, mitochondria oxidize the pyruvate into water and carbon dioxide by means of the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. This second step requires oxygen. The net result is ATP, the energy carrier used by the cell for metabolic activities and to perform work, such as muscle contraction. When the energy in ATP is used during cell work via ATP hydrolysis, hydrogen ions, (positively charged protons) are released. The mitochondria normally incorporate these free hydrogen nuclei back into ATP, thus preventing buildup of unbound hydrogen cations, and maintaining neutral pH. If oxygen supply is inadequate (hypoxia), the mitochondria are unable to continue creating ATP at a rate sufficient to meet the cell's energy needs. In this situation, glycolysis is increased to provide additional ATP, and the excess pyruvate produced is converted into lactate and released from the cell into the bloodstream, where it accumulates over time. While increased glycolysis helps compensate for less ATP from oxidative phosphorylation, it cannot bind the hydrogen cations that result from ATP hydrolysis."}

However, the most frequent complication of styes is progression to a chalazion that causes cosmetic deformity, corneal irritation, and often requires surgical removal. Complications may also arise from the improper surgical lancing, and mainly consist of disruption of lash growth, lid deformity or lid fistula. Styes that are too large may interfere with one's vision. Eyelid cellulitis is another potential complication of eye styes, which is a generalized infection of the eyelid. Progression of a stye to a systemic infection (spreading throughout the body) is extremely rare, and only a few instances of such spread have been recorded. Styes are most commonly caused by the blocking of an oil gland at the base of the eyelash. Styes are experienced by people of all ages. Styes can be triggered by poor nutrition, sleep deprivation, lack of hygiene, lack of water, and rubbing of the eyes. Styes often result from a Staphylococcal infection in the eye, and can be secondary to blepharitis or a deficiency in immunoglobulin. Sharing of washcloths or face towels should be curtailed to avoid spreading the infection between individuals. Styes can last from one to two weeks without treatment, or as little as four days if treated properly. Stye prevention is closely related to proper hygiene. Proper hand washing can reduce the risks of developing not only styes, but also many other types of infections. Upon awakening, application of a warm washcloth to the eyelids for one to two minutes may be beneficial in decreasing the occurrence of styes by liquefying the contents of the oil glands of the eyelid and thereby preventing blockage. To prevent developing styes, it is recommended to never share cosmetics or cosmetic eye tools with other people. People should also keep their eye tools clean and generally practice proper eye hygiene. It is also recommended to remove makeup every night before going to sleep and discard old or contaminated eye makeup. Most cases of styes resolve on their own, without professional care."}

Central nervous system involvement may cause strokes or seizures. Kidney involvement can produce varying degrees of kidney failure, such as hypertension, edema, oliguria, and uremia. Involvement of the arteries of the heart may cause a heart attack, heart failure, and inflammation of the sac around the heart (pericarditis).

In the pediatric population, cutaneous PAN is frequently associated to streptococcal infections, and positive streptococcal serology is included in the diagnostic criteria. No specific lab tests exist for diagnosing polyarteritis nodosa. Diagnosis is generally based on the physical examination and a few laboratory studies that help confirm the diagnosis: A patient is said to have polyarteritis nodosa if he or she has three of the 10 signs known as the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, when a radiographic or pathological diagnosis of vasculitis is made: In polyarteritis nodosa, small aneurysms are strung like the beads of a rosary, therefore making \"rosary sign\" an important diagnostic feature of the vasculitis. The 1990 ACR criteria were designed for classification purposes only. Nevertheless, their good discriminatory performances, indicated by the initial ACR analysis, suggested their potential usefulness for diagnostic purposes as well. Subsequent studies did not confirm their diagnostic utility, demonstrating a significant dependence of their discriminative abilities on the prevalence of the various vasculitides in the analyzed populations. Recently, an original study, combining the analysis of more than 100 items used to describe patients' characteristics in a large sample of vasculitides with a computer simulation technique designed to test the potential diagnostic utility of the various criteria, proposed a set of eight positively or negatively discriminating items to be used as a screening tool for diagnosis in patients suspected of systemic vasculitis. Treatment involves medications to suppress the immune system, including prednisone and cyclophosphamide. In some cases, methotrexate or leflunomide may be helpful."}

Krukenberg tumors can occasionally provoke a reaction of the ovarian stroma which leads to hormone production, that results in vaginal bleeding, a change in menstrual habits, or hirsutism, or occasionally virilization as a main symptom. All these symptoms are non-specific and can also arise with a range of problems other than cancer, and a diagnosis can only be made following confirmatory investigations such as computed tomography (CT) scans, laparotomy and/or a biopsy of the ovary. Krukenberg tumors can be seen in all age groups, with an average age of 45 years. In most countries, cancer that has metastasized to the ovary accounts for only about 1 to 2% of ovarian cancer; in the remainder, the ovary itself is the primary cancer site. However, in Japan they represent a much higher percentage of malignancies in the ovary (almost 20%) due to the increased prevalence of gastric cancer. Krukenberg tumors account for about 15% of metastatic cancers that initially appear to have arisen in the ovary, and as such is less common than metastasis arising from ovarian epithelial and germ-cell tumors. In people who have had nongynecologic malignancy, approximately 20% of adnexal masses are malignant, and 60% of these are Krukenberg tumors. There has been debate over the exact mechanism of metastasis of the tumor cells from the stomach, appendix or colon to the ovaries. Classically it was thought that direct seeding across the abdominal cavity accounted for the spread of this tumor, but spread by way of the lymphatic is considered more likely. The average age of diagnosis of Krukenberg tumors may partly relate to the relatively increased vascularity of the ovaries. Microscopically, Krukenberg tumors are often characterized by mucin-secreting signet-ring cells in the tissue of the ovary; when the primary tumor is discovered, the same signet-ring cells are typically found. However, other microscopic features can predominate. Krukenberg tumors are most commonly metastases from gastric cancer, particularly adenocarcinoma, or breast cancer particularly invasive lobular breast carcinoma, but they can arise in the appendix, colon, small intestine, rectum, gallbladder, and urinary bladder or gallbladder, biliary tract, pancreas, ampulla of Vater or uterine cervix. Immunohistochemistry may help in diagnosing Krukenberg tumors from primary ovarian neoplasms but needs to be applied with discretion. For example, tumors that are immunoreactive to CEA or cytokeratin 20 (CK20) and negative for cytokeratin 7 (CK7) may be more likely to be of colorectal origin. Since Krukenberg tumors are secondary (metastatic), management might logically be driven by identifying and treating the primary cancer. The optimal treatment of Krukenberg tumors is unclear. The role of surgical resection has not been adequately addressed but if metastasis is limited to the ovaries, surgery may improve survival. The role of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy is uncertain but may sometimes be beneficial."}

Mutations in the GLI3 gene cause Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome. The GLI3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that controls gene expression, which is a process that regulates whether genes are turned on or off in particular cells. By interacting with certain genes at specific times during development, the GLI3 protein plays a role in the normal shaping (patterning) of many organs and tissues before birth. Different genetic changes involving the Gli3 gene can cause Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome. In some cases, the condition results from a chromosomal abnormality, such as a large deletion or translocation of genetic material, in the region of chromosome 7 that contains the GLI3 gene. In other cases, a mutation in the GLI3 gene itself is responsible for the disorder. Each of these genetic changes prevents one copy of the gene in each cell from producing any functional protein. It remains unclear how a reduced amount of this protein disrupts early development and causes the characteristic features of Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means the defective gene is located on an autosome, and only one copy of the defective GLI3 gene is sufficient to cause the disorder. In cases of dominant inheritance, an affected person inherits the genetic mutation or chromosomal abnormality from one affected parent. Rare instances of this disorder are sporadic, and occur in people with no history of the condition in their family."}

It is characteristically worse in the morning, generalized in character and throbbing in nature. It may be associated with nausea and vomiting. The headache can be made worse by any activity that further increases the intracranial pressure, such as coughing and sneezing. The pain may also be experienced in the neck and shoulders. Many have pulsatile tinnitus, a whooshing sensation in one or both ears (64\u201387%); this sound is synchronous with the pulse. Various other symptoms, such as numbness of the extremities, generalized weakness, loss of smell, and loss of coordination, are reported more rarely; none are specific for IIH. In children, numerous nonspecific signs and symptoms may be present. The increased pressure leads to compression and traction of the cranial nerves, a group of nerves that arise from the brain stem and supply the face and neck. Most commonly, the abducens nerve (sixth nerve) is involved. This nerve supplies the muscle that pulls the eye outward. Those with sixth nerve palsy therefore experience horizontal double vision which is worse when looking towards the affected side. More rarely, the oculomotor nerve and trochlear nerve (third and fourth nerve palsy, respectively) are affected; both play a role in eye movements. The facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve) is affected occasionally \u2013- the result is total or partial weakness of the muscles of facial expression on one or both sides of the face. The increased pressure leads to papilledema, which is swelling of the optic disc, the spot where the optic nerve enters the eyeball. This occurs in practically all cases of IIH, but not everyone experiences symptoms from this. Those who do experience symptoms typically report \"transient visual obscurations\", episodes of difficulty seeing that occur in both eyes but not necessarily at the same time. Long-term untreated papilledema leads to visual loss, initially in the periphery but progressively towards the center of vision. Physical examination of the nervous system is typically normal apart from the presence of papilledema, which is seen on examination of the eye with a small device called an ophthalmoscope or in more detail with a fundus camera. If there are cranial nerve abnormalities, these may be noticed on eye examination in the form of a squint (third, fourth, or sixth nerve palsy) or as facial nerve palsy."}

The most common are dry skin, overgrown nails, creases on the baby's palms and soles of their feet, minimal fat, abundant hair on their head, and either a brown, green, or yellow discoloration of their skin. Doctors diagnose post-mature birth based on the baby's physical appearance and the length of the mother's pregnancy. However, some postmature babies may show no or few signs of postmaturity. The causes of post-term births are unknown, but post-mature births are more likely when the mother has experienced a previous post-mature birth. Due dates are easily miscalculated when the mother is unsure of her last menstrual period. When there is a miscalculation, the baby could be delivered before or after the expected due date. Post-mature births can also be attributed to irregular menstrual cycles. When the menstrual period is irregular it is very difficult to judge when the ovaries would be available for fertilization and subsequent pregnancy. Some post-mature pregnancies are because the mother is not certain of her last period, so in reality the baby is not technically post-mature. However, in most countries where gestation is measured by ultrasound scan technology, this is less likely. Once a baby is diagnosed post-mature, the mother should be offered additional monitoring as this can provide valuable clues that the baby's health is being maintained. Regular movements of the baby is the best sign indicating that it is still in good health. The mother should keep a \"kick-chart\" to record the movements of her baby. A rate of fewer than 10 movements in 2 hours is not a good sign, and a doctor should be contacted. If there is a reduction in the number of movements it could indicate placental deterioration. Electronic fetal monitoring uses a cardiotocograph to check the baby's heartbeat and is typically monitored over a 30-minute period. If the heartbeat proves to be normal, the doctor will not usually suggest induced labor. An ultrasound scan evaluates the amount of amniotic fluid around the baby. If the placenta is deteriorating, then the amount of fluid will be low, and induced labor is highly recommended."}

Myotonic dystrophy may have a cortical cataract with a blue dot appearance, or a posterior subcapsular cataract. DM2 is generally milder than DM1, with generally fewer DM2 people requiring assistive devices than DM1 people. In addition, the severe congenital form that affects babies in DM1 has not been found in DM2 and the early onset of symptoms is rarely noted to appear in younger people in the medical literature. Symptoms may appear at any time from infancy to adulthood. DM causes general weakness, usually beginning in the muscles of the hands, feet, neck, or face. It slowly progresses to involve other muscle groups, including the heart. DM affects a wide variety of other organ systems as well. Myotonic dystrophy is a genetic condition which is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and thus will be passed along to 50% of a carrier's offspring, on average. Myotonic dystrophy is one of several known trinucleotide repeat disorders. Certain areas of DNA have repeated sequences of two or three nucleotides. Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is an inherited disease. A severe form of DM, congenital myotonic dystrophy, may appear in newborns of mothers who have DM. Congenital myotonic dystrophy can also be inherited via the paternal gene, although it is said to be relatively rare. Congenital means that the condition is present from birth."}

However, individuals may experience palpitations, dizziness, shortness of breath, or infrequently syncope (fainting or near fainting) during episodes of supraventricular tachycardia. The telltale \"delta wave\" may sometimes be seen on an electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG). Electrical activity in the normal human heart begins when a cardiac action potential arises in the sinoatrial (SA) node, which is located in the right atrium. From there, the electrical stimulus is transmitted via internodal pathways to the atrioventricular (AV) node. After a brief delay at the AV node, the stimulus travels through the bundle of His to the left and right bundle branches and then to the Purkinje fibers and the endocardium at the apex of the heart, then finally to the ventricular myocardium. The AV node serves an important function as a \"gatekeeper\", limiting the electrical activity that reaches the ventricles. In situations where the atria generate excessively rapid electrical activity (such as atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter), the AV node limits the number of signals conducted to the ventricles. For example, if the atria are electrically activated at 300 beats per minute, half those electrical impulses may be blocked by the AV node, so that the ventricles are stimulated at only 150 beats per minute\u2014resulting in a pulse of 150 beats per minute. Another important property of the AV node is that it slows down individual electrical impulses. This is manifested on the electrocardiogram as the PR interval (the time from electrical activation of the atria to electrical activation of the ventricles), which is usually shortened to less than 120 milliseconds in duration. Individuals with WPW have an accessory pathway that communicates between the atria and the ventricles, in addition to the AV node. This accessory pathway is known as the bundle of Kent. This accessory pathway does not share the rate-slowing properties of the AV node, and may conduct electrical activity at a significantly higher rate than the AV node. For instance, in the example above, if an individual had an atrial rate of 300 beats per minute, the accessory bundle may conduct all the electrical impulses from the atria to the ventricles, causing the ventricles to contract at 300 beats per minute. Extremely rapid heart rates such as this may result in hemodynamic instability or cardiogenic shock. In some cases, the combination of an accessory pathway and abnormal heart rhythms can trigger ventricular fibrillation, a leading cause of sudden cardiac death. WPW may be associated with PRKAG2, a protein kinase enzyme encoded by the PRKAG2 gene. The bundle of Kent is an abnormal extra or accessory conduction pathway between the atria and ventricles that is present in a small percentage (between 0. 1 and 0."}
{"input": "Symptoms related to aortic stenosis depend on the degree of stenosis.

Most people with mild to moderate aortic stenosis do not have symptoms. Symptoms usually present in individuals with severe aortic stenosis, though they may occur in those with mild to moderate aortic stenosis as well. The three main symptoms of aortic stenosis are loss of consciousness, anginal chest pain and shortness of breath with activity or other symptoms of heart failure such as shortness of breath while lying flat, episodes of shortness of breath at night, or swollen legs and feet. It may also be accompanied by the characteristic \"Dresden china\" appearance of pallor with a light flush. Angina in setting of heart failure also increases the risk of death. In people with angina, the 5-year mortality rate is 50% if the aortic valve is not replaced. Angina in the setting of AS occurs due to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) that is caused by the constant production of increased pressure required to overcome the pressure gradient caused by the AS. While the muscular layer of the left ventricle thickens, the arteries that supply the muscle do not get significantly longer or bigger, so the muscle may not receive enough blood supply to meet its oxygen requirement. This ischemia may first be evident during exercise when the heart muscle requires increased blood supply to compensate for the increased workload. The individual may complain of anginal chest pain with exertion. At this stage, a cardiac stress test with imaging may be suggestive of ischemia. Eventually, however, the heart muscle will require more blood supply at rest than can be supplied by the coronary artery branches. At this point there may be signs of ventricular strain pattern (ST segment depression and T wave inversion) on the EKG, suggesting subendocardial ischemia. The subendocardium is the region that is most susceptible to ischemia because it is the most distant from the epicardial coronary arteries. Syncope (fainting spells) from aortic valve stenosis is usually exertional. In the setting of heart failure it increases the risk of death. In people with syncope, the 3 year mortality rate is 50%, if the aortic valve is not replaced. It is unclear why aortic stenosis causes syncope. One popular theory is that severe AS produces a nearly fixed cardiac output."}

The protozoan parasite is transmitted through the eggs of a nematode, Heterakis gallinarum. The eggs are highly resistant to environmental conditions, and H. meleagridis is, in turn, highly viable inside the eggs, even for years. Birds are infected once they ingest the eggs of the nematode in soil, or sometimes through earthworms which had ingested the egg-contaminated soil. Outbreak can occur rapidly from the heavily infected bird in a flock readily through normal contact between uninfected and infected birds and their droppings in the total absence of cecal worms. For this reason, infection can spread very quickly. Once inside the digestive system of the host, the protozoan is moved to the cecum along with the eggs of H. gallinarum. The disease causing agent, Histomonas meliagridis, is transmitted in the eggs of the worm Heterakis gallinarum. Once in the environment, the eggs are carried by earthworms. When the worms are eaten and the eggs hatch in the ceca, the pathogen is released. Bird to bird transmission can also occur from cloacal drinking Visible signs of this disease are cyanosis of the head (hence, \u201cblackhead\u201d) and sulfur-yellow diarrhea. The pathogen causes lesions on the ceca and the liver. The ceca experience ulcerations, enlargement, and caseous masses start to form inside of them.

The relation to rheumatic fever was strengthened by many studies that showed that women with normal pregnancies before rheumatic fever developed chorea in subsequent pregnancies. At least 35% of patients have a definite history of acute rheumatic fever and Sydenham chorea; 4% of those with chorea gravidarum had acute rheumatic fever.

A patient developed this chorea with no definite evidence of previous Sydenham's chorea or recent streptoccocal infections, but had anti-basal ganglia antibodies, suggesting immunological basis for the pathophysiology of this chorea. Chorea can also be a manifestation of drug toxicity (for example, anticonvulsants, antiparkinson agents, neuroleptics, steroids, and estrogen), or a result of an infectious disease such as meningovascular syphilis, Lyme disease, viral encephalitis, and many others. Drug treatment is indicated for patients with severe disabling chorea.

Lipiduria (lipids in urine) can also occur, but is not essential for the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. Hyponatremia also occurs with a low fractional sodium excretion. Hyperlipidaemia is caused by two factors: - Hypoproteinemia stimulates protein synthesis in the liver, resulting in the overproduction of lipoproteins. - Lipid catabolism is decreased due to lower levels of lipoprotein lipase, the main enzyme involved in lipoprotein breakdown. Cofactors, such as apolipoprotein C2 may also be lost by increased filtration of proteins. A few other characteristics seen in nephrotic syndrome are: - The most common sign is excess fluid in the body due to the serum hypoalbuminemia. Lower serum oncotic pressure causes fluid to accumulate in the interstitial tissues. Sodium and water retention aggravates the edema. This may take several forms: - Puffiness around the eyes, characteristically in the morning. - Pitting edema over the legs. - Fluid in the pleural cavity causing pleural effusion.

Even simple tasks like cutting in a straight line or using a ruler can range from difficult to impossible, depending on the severity of the condition. In disabling cases, ET can interfere with a person's activities of daily living, including feeding, dressing, and taking care of personal hygiene. Essential tremor generally presents as a rhythmic tremor (4\u201312 Hz) that occurs only when the affected muscle is exerting effort. Any sort of physical or mental stress will tend to make the tremor worse. The tremor may also occur in the head (neck), jaw and voice as well as other body regions, with the general pattern being that the tremor begins in the arms and then spreads to these other regions in some people. Women are more likely to develop the head tremor than are men. Other types of tremor may also occur, including postural tremor of the outstretched arms, intention tremor of the arms and rest tremor in the arms. Some people may have unsteadiness and problems with gait and balance. ET-related tremors do not occur during sleep, but people with ET sometimes complain of an especially coarse tremor upon awakening that becomes noticeably less coarse within the first few minutes of wakefulness. Tremor and disease activity/intensity can worsen in response to fatigue, strong emotions, low blood sugar, cold and heat, caffeine, lithium salts, some antidepressants, and other factors. It is typical for the tremor to worsen in \"performance\" situations, such as when writing a check for payment at a store or giving a presentation.

Unborn and newborn babies are susceptible to strokes. Leukodystrophies are a group of hereditary diseases that are known to cause spastic hemiplegia. Brain infections that cause spastic hemiplegia are meningitis, multiple sclerosis, and encephalitis. The spasticity occurs when the afferent pathways in the brain are compromised and the communication between the brain to the motor fibers is lost. When the inhibitory signals to deactivate the stretch reflex is lost the muscle remains in a constant contracted state. With spastic hemiplegia, one upper extremity and one lower extremity is affected, so cervical, lumbar and sacral segments of the spinal column can be affected.

Although CP is due to permanent damage and is not progressive in nature, without treatment the symptoms can become worse, intensifying in pain and severity, and create complications that were not initially present. Some treatments are preventative measures to help prevent further complications, such as complete paralysis of the arm due to non-use and subsequent worsening hypertonia and joint contracture.

Presentation varies slightly compared to adults with bilateral involvement, uveitis, disc edema and tissue eosinophilia being more common in this population. The presence of uveitis generally implies a poor outcome for pediatric IOI. Bilateral presentation may have a higher incidence of systemic disease. The exact cause of IOI is unknown, but infectious and immune-mediated mechanisms have been proposed. Several studies have described cases where onset of orbital pseudotumor was seen simultaneously or several weeks after upper respiratory infections. Another study by Wirostko et al. proposes that organisms resembling Mollicutes cause orbital inflammation by destroying the cytoplasmic organelles of parasitized cells. Orbital pseudotumor has also been observed in association with Crohn\u2019s disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, myasthenia gravis, and ankylosing spondylitis all of which strengthen the basis of IOI being an immune-mediated disease. Response to corticosteroid treatment and immunosuppressive agents also support this idea. Trauma has also been seen to precede some cases of orbital pseudotumor. However, one study by Mottow-Lippe, Jakobiec, and Smith suggests that the release of circulating antigens caused by local vascular permeability triggers an inflammatory cascade in the affected tissues."}

Several types of occlusion myopia have been recorded in tree shrews, macaques, cats and rats, deciphered from several animal-inducing myopia models. Preliminary laboratory investigations using retinoscopy of 240 dogs found myopic problems with varying degrees of refraction errors depending on the breed. In cases involving German Shepherds, Rottweilers and Miniature horses, the refraction errors were indicative of myopia. Nuclear sclerosis of the crystalline lens was noticed in older dogs. Experiments into newborn macaque monkeys have revealed that surgically fusing the eyelid for one year results in eye deterioration as the eye has not had a chance to grow and develop. Keeping monkeys in the dark for a similar period, however, does not lead to myopia. In 1996, Maurice and Mushin conducted tests on rabbits by raising their body temperatures and intraocular pressures (IOP) and noted that while younger rabbits were prone to developing myopia, older rabbits were not. Some tests have revealed that myopia in some animals can be improved with eye drops containing zinc, by increasing the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD). The rhesus monkey's vision amplitude reduction is noticeable in its second decade of life; however the condition does not impede normal functioning. Older rhesus monkeys have more difficulty accommodating this reduction in vision amplitude, encountering difficulty in focussing on objects at close range, even objects on the ground within an arm's length.

They can co-occur with cancer, in approximately 6-9% of cases, most commonly adenocarcinoma, but also including squamous cell carcinoma and transitional cell carcinoma. Approximately 10% of cases co-occur with kidney stones. There are 2 types of urethral diverticulums. Congenital and acquired. In infancy usually the urethral diverticulum is congenital but in rare instances acquired urethral diverticulum can be seen in infancy specially following traumatic catheterization. Common symptoms of urethral diverticulum include incontinence, urinary frequency and urgency, pain during sex, and pain during urination. Other symptoms include pain localized to the urethra or pelvis and frequent urinary tract infection. When urethral diverticulum becomes severe, a painful mass can sometimes be felt inside the introitus of the vagina, which can discharge pus. If the mass is hard or bleeds, complications like cancer or kidney stones may be present. Few urethral diverticula are present at birth; the vast majority are acquired. Acquired urethral diverticula can be caused by trauma and/or infection. When the peri-urethral ducts become infected repeatedly, they can become blocked and eventually cause a diverticulum. They are usually found in the middle of the urethra or the end farthest from the bladder. Congenital urethral diverticula can arise from several embryological sources. These include defects in the primordial folds and remnants of Gartner's duct. Histopathologically, several characteristics are frequently visible in urethral diverticula. These include nephrogenic adenoma, chronic inflammation associated with fibrosis around the glands, small or absent epithelium, chronic cystitis, cystitis cystica, cystitis glandularis, squamous metaplasia, and adenomatous metaplasia. Approximately 1/3 of diverticula are compound or multiple, and some can extend to surround the urethra. Urethral diverticulum is often an incidental finding."}

Grade 1 chondrosarcoma grows relatively slowly, has cells whose histological appearance is quite similar to cells of normal cartilage, and have much less aggressive invasive and metastatic properties. Grades 2 and 3 are increasingly faster-growing cancers, with more varied and abnormal-looking cells, and are much more likely to infiltrate surrounding tissues, lymph nodes, and organs. Some, but not all, authorities and medical facilities assign a \"Grade 4\" to the most anaplastic, undifferentiated cartilage-derived tumors. The most common sites for chondrosarcoma to grow are the pelvis and shoulder, along with the superior metaphyseal and diaphyseal regions of the arms and legs. However, chondrosarcoma may occur in any bone, and are sometimes found in the skull, particularly at its base. ICD-O codes provide a more precise classification of chondrosarcoma. These \"subtypes\" are derived from, and reflect, both (a) the topographical location of the tumor, (b) the histological characteristics of the cancerous cartilage cells, and (c) the makeup of the surrounding matrix material associated with the tumor: The cause is unknown. Patients may have a history of enchondroma or osteochondroma. A small minority of secondary chondrosarcomas occur in patients with Maffucci syndrome and Ollier disease. It has been associated with faulty isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 enzymes, which are also associated with gliomas and leukemias. Imaging studies - including radiographs (\"x-rays\"), computerized tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - are often used to make a presumptive diagnosis of chondrosarcoma. However, a definitive diagnosis depends on the identification of malignant cancer cells producing cartilage in a biopsy specimen that has been examined by a pathologist. In a few cases, usually of highly anaplastic tumors, immunohistochemistry (IHC)is required. There are no blood tests currently available to enable an oncologist to render a diagnosis of chondrosarcoma. The most characteristic imaging findings are usually obtained with CT. Nearly all chondrosarcoma patients appear to be in good health. Often, patients are not aware of the growing tumor until there is a noticeable lump or pain. Earlier diagnosis is generally accidental, when a patient undergoes testing for another problem and physicians discover the cancer. Occasionally the first symptom will be a broken bone at the cancerous site."}

The forehead is prominent with bitemporal hollowing. Characteristics that are not visual include mental retardation, pre- and postnatal growth retardation, epilepsy, and reduced lifespan. Failure to thrive, feeding difficulties, seizures and decreased spontaneous activity are often seen. Death usually occurs in infancy and childhood. Multiple abnormalities of the brain, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract (the stomach and intestines) may occur. MDS is a microdeletion syndrome involving loss of the gene PAFAH1B1 on chromosome 17 which is responsible for the syndrome's characteristic sign of lissencephaly. The loss of another gene, YWHAE , in the same region of chromosome 17 increases the severity of the lissencephaly in patients with Miller\u2013Dieker syndrome. Additional genes in the deleted region are likely to contribute to the varied features of Miller\u2013Dieker syndrome. It may be a random event during the formation of reproductive cells or in early fetal development or due to familial chromosomal rearrangement called chromosomal translocation. In less than 20%, inheritance is through an autosomal dominant pattern. The parent is usually unaffected, but carries a particular chromosomal rearrangement called a balanced translocation, in which no genetic material is gained or lost. Increased rate of unexplained fetal loss may be observed in MDS carriers with balanced translocations although they may be otherwise asymptomatic. However, they can become also unbalanced as they are passed to the next generation. Miller\u2013Dieker syndrome is usually not inherited. The deletion event occurs randomly during gametogenesis (formation of eggs or sperm) or in early foetal development. Therefore, no history of the disorder is usually seen in their families. The disease may be diagnosed by cytogenetic techniques like fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), testing for a microdeletion at LIS1. With the use of prenatal ultrasonographic imaging, early detection of abnormal brain development in the fetus with MDS can be seen."}

Cancers of the mouth are strongly associated with tobacco use, especially use of chewing tobacco or \"dip\", as well as heavy alcohol use. Cancers of this region, particularly the tongue, are more frequently treated with surgery than are other head and neck cancers. Surgeries for oral cancers include - Maxillectomy (can be done with or without orbital exenteration) - Mandibulectomy (removal of the mandible or lower jaw or part of it) - Glossectomy (tongue removal, can be total, hemi or partial) - Radical neck dissection - Mohs procedure - Combinational e. g. , glossectomy and laryngectomy done together. The defect is typically covered/improved by using another part of the body and/or skin grafts and/or wearing a prosthesis. Nasopharyngeal cancer arises in the nasopharynx, the region in which the nasal cavities and the Eustachian tubes connect with the upper part of the throat. While some nasopharyngeal cancers are biologically similar to the common HNSCC, \"poorly differentiated\" nasopharyngeal carcinoma is lymphoepithelioma, which is distinct in its epidemiology, biology, clinical behavior, and treatment, and is treated as a separate disease by many experts. Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) begins in the oropharynx (throat), the middle part of the throat that includes the soft palate, the base of the tongue, and the tonsils. Squamous cell cancers of the tonsils are more strongly associated with human papillomavirus infection than are cancers of other regions of the head and neck. HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer generally has a better outcomes than HPV-negative disease with a 54% better survival, but this advantage for HPV associated cancer applies only to oropharyngeal cancers. People with oropharyngeal carcinomas are at high risk of developing second primary head and neck cancer."}

They can come and go for hours or even weeks at a time, or remain consistent. Gradual onset can begin with the manifestation of a hoarse voice quality, which may later transform into a voice quality described as strained and breaks in phonation. These phonation breaks have been compared to stuttering in the past, but there is a lack of research in support of spasmodic dysphonia being classified as a fluency disorder. It is commonly reported by people with spasmodic dysphonia that symptoms almost only occur on vocal/speech sounds that require phonation. Symptoms are less likely to occur at rest, while whispering, and/or on speech sounds that do not require phonation. It is hypothesized this occurs because of an increase in sporadic, sudden, and prolonged tension found in the muscles around the larynx during phonation. This tension affects the abduction and adduction (opening and closing) of the vocal folds. Consequently, the vocal folds are unable to retain subglottal air pressure (required for phonation) and breaks in phonation can be heard throughout the speech of people with spasmodic dysphonia. Regarding types of spasmodic dysphonia, the main characteristic of spasmodic dysphonia, breaks in phonation, is found along with other varying symptoms. The voice quality of adductor spasmodic dysphonia can be described as \u201cstrained-strangled\u201d from tension in the glottal region. Voice quality for abductor spasmodic dysphonia can be described as breathy from variable widening of the glottal region. Vocal tremor may also be seen in spasmodic dysphonia. A mix and variance of these symptoms are found in mixed spasmodic dysphonia. Symptoms of spasmodic dysphonia typically appear in middle aged people, but have also been seen in people in their twenties, with symptoms emerging as young as teenage years. Although the exact cause of spasmodic dysphonia (i. e. , laryngeal dystonia) is still unknown, epidemiological, genetic and neurological pathogenic factors have been proposed in recent research. Risk factors include: - Being female - Being middle aged - Having a family history of neurological diseases (e. g."}

Macular corneal dystrophy is very common in Iceland and accounts for almost one-third of all corneal grafts performed there. Macular corneal dystrophy is inherited in autosomal recessive fashion and is thought to be caused by the lack or abnormal configuration of keratan sulfate. Most cases of MCD are caused by mutations in CHST6 gene. The gene CHST6 is a carbohydrate sulfotransferase encoding an enzyme designated corneal N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfotransferase. In MCD type I, various mutations lead to inactivation of the enzyme, in MCD type II, inactivation is caused by large deletions and/or replacements in the gene."}

Daegu ist bereits seit langer Zeit das administrative, kulturelle und wirtschaftliche Zentrum des koreanischen S\u00fcdostens. Zwischen 1392 und 1910, w\u00e4hrend der Zeit der Joseon-Dynastie und Gro\u00df-Koreas, war Daegu die Hauptstadt der Provinz Gyeongsang, die 1896 in mehrere Teile gespalten wurde. Zwischen 1910 und 1945 war Korea Teil des Japanischen Kaiserreichs. Da Japanisch in dieser Zeit Nationalsprache war, wurde der Stadtname japanisch Taiky\u016b gelesen. Nach dem Koreakrieg wuchs die Stadt explosionsartig; inzwischen hat sich die Bev\u00f6lkerung mehr als verzehnfacht. Am 28. Februar 1960 verboten die dem Regime von Rhee Syng-man ergebenen Beh\u00f6rden den Obersch\u00fclern der Stadt, an einer Wahlveranstaltung der Opposition teilzunehmen. Dies f\u00fchrte zu gro\u00dfen Unruhen und gewaltsamen Unterdr\u00fcckungsversuchen, was wiederum heftige Proteste auch in anderen St\u00e4dten ausl\u00f6ste und als \u201eDaegu Democracy Movement\u201c in die Geschichtsb\u00fccher einging. Rhee Syng-man musste schlie\u00dflich mit Hilfe der CIA nach Hawaii ausgeflogen werden. Am 14.

V\u00e1c wurde auch als \"Wac civitas\" im Jahr 1075 in einem Stiftungsbrief der Abtei in Garamszentbenedek erw\u00e4hnt. Der Stadtname V\u00e1c kommt wahrscheinlich von einem Personennamen.

Damals soll in dieser Gegend ein Einsiedler namens V\u00e1c gelebt haben. Ein weiterer Erkl\u00e4rungsversuch leitet den Stadtnamen vom ungarischen Stamm Vath ab. Das Wort V\u00e1c kommt aus dem Slavischen und bedeutet: wichtige Siedlung oder Zentrum. Der mittelalterliche Stadtkern war urspr\u00fcnglich eine Burg bzw. Festung im s\u00fcdlichen Teil der Innenstadt, die auf einem H\u00fcgel am Flussufer errichtet wurde. Im Jahre 1241 fielen mongolische Tataren in V\u00e1c ein. Die Bev\u00f6lkerung fl\u00fcchtete sich in die Burgkirche, die von den Tataren niedergebrannt wurde, wobei alle dorthin Gefl\u00fcchteten ums Leben kamen.

Im Zuge ihrer Landnahme ab 711 unterwarfen die Mauren auch Castro de Rei. Der heutige Ortsname stammt vermutlich aus dieser Zeit, und entwickelte sich aus dem arabischen Wort taroca, etwa frequentiert oder h\u00e4ufig besucht. Lamego war zu der Zeit gesch\u00e4ftlich mit dem Emirat von C\u00f3rdoba und dann dem Kalifat von C\u00f3rdoba verbunden, und in dem Zusammenhang war auch das nahe Tarouca von Bedeutung, das bereits zu Zeiten der r\u00f6mischen Besatzung an zwei sich kreuzenden R\u00f6merstra\u00dfen lag und so bereits traditionell eine relative Bedeutung als Handelsort hatte. K\u00f6nig Ferdinand von Le\u00f3n nahm Tarouca den Mauren im Jahr 1057 ab. Portugals erster K\u00f6nig D. Afonso Henriques lie\u00df hier ab 1140 mit dem Kloster S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o de Tarouca das erste Zisterzienserkloster im Land errichten, dem das ab 1159 ausgebaute und 1168 den Zisterziensern \u00fcbergebene Kloster Salzedas folgte, auf Initiative der Dona Teresa Afonso, Gattin des D. Afonso Henriques-Lehrers Egas Moniz. Erste Stadtrechte erhielt die Kreisstadt Tarouca 1262, noch als Castro Rei. Ab 1364 wurde der Ort dann bereits als Tarouca gef\u00fchrt. Tarouca ist Sitz eines gleichnamigen Kreises (Concelho). Die Nachbarkreise sind (im Uhrzeigersinn im Norden beginnend): Armamar, Moimenta da Beira, Vila Nova de Paiva, Castro Daire sowie Lamego. Mit der Gebietsreform im September 2013 wurden mehrere Gemeinden zu neuen Gemeinden zusammengefasst, sodass sich die Zahl der Gemeinden von zuvor zehn auf sieben verringerte.

Ein Modell der Anlage wird im Botanischen Museum in Berlin gezeigt. Im Wirtschaftsleben spielte die Westafrikanische Pflanzungsgesellschaft Victoria (WAPV) eine gewichtige Rolle, die dort ihre Hauptpflanzung unterhielt und ab 1910 eigene Fabrikationsanlagen zur Aufbereitung von \u00d6lpalmprodukten betrieb. Auch andere Handels- und Plantagenunternehmungen waren mit Niederlassungen vertreten, darunter die Ambas Bay Trayding Co. Ltd.

Eine Pulver- und Papierm\u00fchle bestand sp\u00e4testens ab 1499. Die Papierm\u00fchle, eine der \u00e4ltesten im N\u00fcrnberger Land, bestand noch bis in den Zweiten Weltkrieg. Aus der Pulverm\u00fchle entstand nach dem Drei\u00dfigj\u00e4hrigen Krieg ein Kupferhammer, schlie\u00dflich ein Zain- und Eisenhammer. Seit 1504 geh\u00f6rte R\u00f6thenbach zum Territorium der Reichsstadt N\u00fcrnberg und kam somit in den Fr\u00e4nkischen Reichskreis. 1806 wurde R\u00f6thenbach wie das gesamte Landgebiet der Reichsstadt ein Teil des K\u00f6nigreichs Bayern. Im Jahr 1818 wird R\u00f6thenbach eine Gemeinde. 1880 errichtete Conrad Conradty eine Bleistiftfabrik, die sp\u00e4ter mit der Produktion elektrogalvanischer Kohlen erweitert wurde. Seitdem wuchs R\u00f6thenbach, das 1723 nur neun und 1880 380 Einwohner z\u00e4hlte, sehr stark. Der Unternehmer hatte zwischen 1892 und 1914 die sogenannte Conradty-Siedlung errichten lassen. Bis zu Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges entstanden 180 H\u00e4user mit \u00fcber 700 Wohneinheiten f\u00fcr die Arbeiter in der N\u00e4he der Fabrikgeb\u00e4ude, wobei der Mietzins sehr sozial gehalten war. Diese Siedlung aus der Gr\u00fcnderzeit ist, noch in wesentlichen Teilen erhalten und behutsam saniert, ein hochrangiges Denkmal der Industriegeschichte. 1937 verlegte die Firma Diehl Teile ihrer Produktion nach R\u00f6thenbach, was zus\u00e4tzlich das Wachstum der Gemeinde f\u00f6rderte. Zur Stadt erhoben wurde R\u00f6thenbach auf Beschluss des Bayerischen Innenministeriums vom 20. Mai 1953."}

Nowy Dw\u00f3r Gda\u0144ski entstand als eine Ansiedlung neben einem Dom\u00e4nengut der Familie Loitz, einem Kaufmannsgeschlecht aus Danzig, das 1572 seinen Besitz wegen \u00dcberschuldung verkaufen musste. Unter den n\u00e4chsten Besitzern, der Familie Weiher, wurde der Tiegenhof zum Haupthof einer Starostei. Im Laufe der Zeit wuchs die Siedlung zu einem Marktort mit Handwerkern, Kr\u00e4mern, Kr\u00fcgern und G\u00e4rtnern. Au\u00dferhalb des Ortes befanden sich 1664 noch zwei Windm\u00fchlen und eine Schnapsbrennerei. Auf dem Gel\u00e4nde des Haupthofes entstand 1784 eine evangelische Kirche, die zwischen 1831 und 1834 nach Pl\u00e4nen von Karl Friedrich Schinkel neu aufgebaut wurde. 1848 erfolgte der Bau einer katholischen Kirche. Nachdem Tiegenhof seit 1859 den Status eines Marktfleckens innehatte, erhielt es 1880 Stadtrecht. Seit 1881 hat Tiegenhof einen Eisenbahnanschluss, der 1886 \u00fcber Neuteich bis Simonsdorf erweitert wurde. Seit 1900 ist die Stadt auch an das Schmalspurbahnnetz der ehemaligen Westpreu\u00dfischen Kleinbahnen AG (heute: \u017bu\u0142awska Kolej Dojazdowa) angeschlossen. Traditionsreiche Betriebe in Tiegenhof waren die Machandelfabrik der Familie Stobbe, die seit 1776 Wacholderschnaps brannte, und die seit 1784 bestehende Brauerei Stobbe. Auch die Tiegenhofer \u00d6lm\u00fchle und die Zuckerfabrik hatten einen guten Ruf. Die Stadt geh\u00f6rte seit 1818 dem Landkreis Marienburg (Westpr. ) an. Seit 1920 war sie die Kreisstadt des Landkreises Gro\u00dfes Werder, der bis 1939 Teil der Freien Stadt Danzig war. In Tiegenhof befanden sich zwei Au\u00dfenkommandos des KZ Stutthof, eins in der Hauptwerkstatt der Kleinbahn, ein zweites in der Ziegelei.

Durch die Br\u00fcder Ludwig und Hasso von Wedel erfolgte 1372 der Bau eines Schlosses. Infolge des 1402 durch K\u00f6nig Sigismund vollzogenen Verkaufs der Neumark an den Deutschen Orden wurde N\u00f6renberg in die Kriegshandlungen zwischen den Ordensrittern und Polen-Litauen hineingezogen. 1421 fielen die Polen ein und pl\u00fcnderten die Stadt und das Schloss. In N\u00f6renberg, das seit 1454 wieder brandenburgisch geworden war, erfolgte 1530 die Reformation und das Dominikanerkloster wurde aufgel\u00f6st. Durch den Drei\u00dfigj\u00e4hrigen Krieg erlitt der Ort schwere Sch\u00e4den. Im Jahre 1682 fiel der Kirchturm ein und den N\u00f6renbergern fehlte das Geld f\u00fcr den Wiederaufbau, so dass lediglich ein Glockenstuhl errichtet werden konnte. Seit 1775 wurden die von G\u00f6tze und Bornstedt neue Schlossherren. Bei der Neuorganisation der Verwaltungsbezirke im Jahre 1816 wurde N\u00f6renberg aus der Neumark herausgel\u00f6st und dem pommerschen Landkreis Saatzig zugeordnet. Bis in die Mitte des 19.

Die Stadt wurde in der N\u00e4he einer prussischen Siedlung erbaut, nach Goldbeck im Jahr 1230, und auf alten Stadtsiegeln Schiffenburc oder Schiffenburg genannt. Die Stadt scheint danach zerst\u00f6rt worden zu sein, denn 1351 erhielt sie vom Hochmeister des Deutschen Ordens eine Handfeste. Ein Siegelabdruck an der Urkunde von 1351 zeigte ein Schiff vor dem Hintergrund einer Burg mit der Umschrift S'. CIVITATIS SCHIFFENBURC. Dass der sp\u00e4ter \u00fcbliche Name Schippenbeil nach dem Komtur des Deutschen Ordens Ludwig von Schippen benannt ist, gilt nicht als sicher.

Die Endung \u201eBeil\u201c deutet auf die altpreu\u00dfische Siedlung hin (vgl. das deutsche Wort Weiler, aber auch die weiter westlich gelegene Stadt Heiligenbeil). Nachdem es innerhalb des Deutschordensstaats zu einem Streit um L\u00e4ndereien zwischen dem Bischof von Ermland und dem Deutschen Orden gekommen war, wurde in einem Schiedsverfahren vom 28. und 29. Juli 1374 die bis in die Neuzeit g\u00fcltigen Grenzen Ermlands festgelegt, und die St\u00e4dte Rastenburg, Bartenstein und Schippenbeil wurden dem Orden zugesprochen. Im Jahr 1749 brannte das alte, zwei Etagen hohe Rathaus in Stadtmitte ab. 1753 wurde ein neues Rathaus in Massivbauweise fertiggestellt, dessen Baukosten 4. 000 Taler betragen hatten. 1807 wurde dieses architektonisch ansprechend gestaltete Rathaus in der Nacht vor der Schlacht bei Friedland von den Russen niedergebrannt. Die Ruine des Rathauses wurde danach abgetragen, und der fr\u00fchere Standplatz wurde gepflastert und diente seither als Teil des Marktplatzes. Von 1818 bis 1927 geh\u00f6rte Schippenbeil zum Landkreis Friedland und \u2013 nach dessen Umbenennung \u2013 von 1927 bis 1945 zum Landkreis Bartenstein im Regierungsbezirk K\u00f6nigsberg der Provinz Ostpreu\u00dfen des Deutschen Reichs.

Die eigentliche Stadt entstand 1961 (gilt als Gr\u00fcndungsjahr) an Stelle eines zuvor existierenden Dorfes im Zusammenhang mit der Errichtung eines Zellulose- und Papierwerkes am Ufer des Baikalsees. Das Werk nahm seinen Betrieb 1965 auf; dem Ort wurde 1966 der Stadtstatus verliehen. S\u00fcdlich der Stadt liegt ein gut erschlossenes alpines Skigebiet am etwa 1300 Meter hohen Berg Sobolinaja (Zobelberg) mit gew\u00f6hnlicher Schneesicherheit von November bis in den Mai. Weiter s\u00fcdlich erheben sich die Berge des Chamar-Daban bis \u00fcber 2100 Meter; Baikalsk ist einer der Ausgangspunkte f\u00fcr Touren in das Gebirge. Stadtbildendes Unternehmen war das Baikal-Zellulose-und-Papier-Kombinat () einige Kilometer \u00f6stlich der Stadt, in dem etwa jeder vierte Einwohner direkt besch\u00e4ftigt war. Das Werk galt als gr\u00f6\u00dfter Verschmutzer des zum UNESCO-Weltnaturerbe geh\u00f6renden Baikalsees. Die Schlie\u00dfung der Fabrik erfolgte im Dezember 2013. Ein kleiner Teil der Anlage wird noch zur Erzeugung von Warmwasser und Fernw\u00e4rme f\u00fcr die Ortschaft genutzt. Die Anzahl der Einwohner in Baikalsk geht aufgrund der Schlie\u00dfung zur\u00fcck.

Bis in die 1870er Jahre entwickelte sich Saginaw, das an der M\u00fcndung eines gro\u00dfen Flusssystems liegt, zu einem Zentrum des Holzumschlags auf Schiff und Eisenbahn. Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts entstand eine Automobil-Zulieferindustrie mit zahlreichen Werken, die vor allem von General Motors betrieben wurden. Nach der Weltwirtschaftskrise wanderten zahlreiche Menschen zu, vor allem Afroamerikaner. Im Zweiten Weltkrieg wurde Saginaw zu einem Zentrum der Waffen- und Munitionsindustrie. Hier wurde der leichte M1-Selbstladekarabiner produziert. War Saginaw einst eine prosperierende Industriestadt, so sind Holz- und Autoindustrie seit den 1980er-Jahren im Abstieg begriffen. In der Krise 2007\u20132012 beschleunigte sich der Niedergang, was zu starken demographischen Verlusten und einer erh\u00f6hten Arbeitslosigkeit beitrug.

Der spanische Ortsname bedeutet Heiliges Kreuz der Berge. Santa Cruz war lange eine von Landwirtschaft und Viehzucht gepr\u00e4gte Kleinstadt, deren Zweck die Versorgung des Hochlandes mit landwirtschaftlichen Produkten war. Nach der Unabh\u00e4ngigkeit Boliviens wurde Santa Cruz 1826 Hauptstadt des neu geschaffenen gleichnamigen Departamentos, dennoch blieb es eine relativ abgelegene und schwer zu erreichende Kleinstadt. Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts verlor Santa Cruz massiv an Bedeutung, da mit der Er\u00f6ffnung der Eisenbahnlinien vom Hochland an die Pazifikk\u00fcste der Import landwirtschaftlicher Produkte aus dem Ausland wesentlich billiger wurde als der aufwendige Transport mit Maultieren aus Santa Cruz. Der wirtschaftliche Aufschwung und das Wachstum von Santa Cruz zur heutigen Bedeutung begannen, nachdem es in den 1950er Jahren durch Hauptstra\u00dfen mit dem Rest des Landes verbunden wurde und die umfangreichen \u00d6l- und Gasvorkommen der Region erschlossen wurden. Aufgrund der inzwischen erreichten Stellung als wirtschaftliches Zentrum Boliviens gibt es politische Str\u00f6mungen, die eine st\u00e4rkere Unabh\u00e4ngigkeit von der Zentralregierung in La Paz und regionale Autonomie fordern. Der Hauptwirtschaftszweig in der Stadt ist die Verarbeitung der landwirtschaftlichen Produkte (tropische Erzeugnisse, wie Kaffee, Zuckerrohr und Tabak), die im Umland angebaut werden. Die Landwirtschaft erlebt seit mehreren Jahren einen Boom in der Zone, so dass die Bev\u00f6lkerungszahl von Stadt und Umland sehr schnell angestiegen ist. Das Klima ist am \u00dcbergang des Amazonasbeckens zum Gran Chaco tropisch gem\u00e4\u00dfigt mit einer Regenzeit im Sommer. Die Temperaturen schwanken zwischen 20 \u00b0C im Winter und bis zu 40 \u00b0C im Sommer. Im Winter kann es durch kalte S\u00fcdwinde (Surazos) mit polarem Ursprung zu pl\u00f6tzlichen K\u00e4lteeinbr\u00fcchen mit Temperaturen um 10 \u00b0C kommen. Die Region um Santa Cruz verf\u00fcgt \u00fcber die zweitgr\u00f6\u00dften Erdgasvorkommen in S\u00fcdamerika. Santa Cruz gilt als die architektonisch modernste, wirtschaftlich dynamischste und wohlhabendste Stadt Boliviens. Es ist Universit\u00e4tsstadt und Sitz einer deutschen Schule.

Obwohl es innerhalb des Stadtgebietes nur wenige Seen gibt, liegen im Umkreis von 40 Kilometern um Brainerd \u00fcber 460 Seen, die meisten n\u00f6rdlich der Stadt. Diese Gegend wird auch Brainerd Lakes Area genannt. Brainerd liegt an der Kreuzung des Minnesota State Highway 210 und des Minnesota State Highway 371. Rund f\u00fcnf Kilometer nord\u00f6stlich der Stadt liegt der Brainerd Lakes Regional Airport, ein regionaler Flughafen mit drei Start- und Landebahnen und einem Helipad. Einzige kommerzielle Fluggesellschaft ist Mesaba Airlines, die als Tochtergesellschaft von Northwest Airlines Fl\u00fcge nach Minneapolis/St. Paul, Devils Lake und Jamestown durchf\u00fchrt. Urspr\u00fcnglich geh\u00f6rten die Gebiete um das heutige Brainerd den Ojibwe-Indianern. Erster wei\u00dfer Entdecker war Zebulon Pike, der auf der Suche nach dem Quellgebiet des Mississippi River an Weihnachten 1805 durch die Region zog. Mit dem Crow Wing Village, einem Pelz- und Holzf\u00e4llerlager nahe Fort Ripley kamen seit Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts Siedler in die Gegend. Zu dieser Zeit kam es h\u00e4ufiger zu Konflikten zwischen den Indianern und wei\u00dfen Siedlern. Bekanntes Beispiel ist der sogenannte \u201eBlueberry War\u201c im Jahre 1872, als zwei Ojibwe als vermutete M\u00f6rder eines vermissten M\u00e4dchen geh\u00e4ngt wurden. Als eine Gruppe von Indianern die Stadt aufsuchten, wurden Truppen aus dem nahe gelegenen Fort Ripley angefordert um eine bef\u00fcrchtete Auseinandersetzung zu vermeiden. Es stellte sich jedoch heraus, dass die Ojibwe lediglich Blaubeeren in der Stadt verkaufen wollten. Der Name der Stadt stammt von einem Vorsitzenden der Northern Pacific Railway, J. Gregory Smith, der 1870 die neu gegr\u00fcndete Township nach seiner Frau, Ann Eliza Brainerd Smith und seinem Schwiegervater Lawrence Brainerd benannte. Die Eisenbahngesellschaft hatte eine Br\u00fccke \u00fcber den Mississippi gebaut und nutzte den Bahnhof von Brainerd als Maschinenhalle und Werkstatt. Am 6."}

Die erste Erw\u00e4hnung des auf der von der Neckarschleife umflossenen Landzunge liegenden Ortsteils Ersheim erfolgte im Lorscher Codex mit einer auf 773 datierten Stiftung (Lorscher Urkunden, Nr. 2624).

Nach ihm wurde auch der Ort benannt, der 1872 als Stadt aufgenommen wurde. 1866 \u00f6ffnete das erste Postb\u00fcro. 1876 nahm das Texas A&M College seine T\u00e4tigkeit auf und ein Jahr sp\u00e4ter wurde der Bryan Independent School District gebildet. 1884 war die Einwohnerzahl auf 3000 gestiegen und 1889 begann man mit der Elektrifizierung und dem Aufbau der st\u00e4dtischen Wasserversorgung. Im Jahr 1900 bekam Bryan Anschluss an eine zweite Eisenbahngesellschaft, der International-Great Northern Railroad und die Einwohnerzahl war auf 3589 gestiegen. 1902 wurde die \u00f6ffentliche Bibliothek Carnegie Library er\u00f6ffnet. Sie wurde durch eine Stiftung in H\u00f6he von 10. 000 $ von Andrew Carnegie, einem schottischen Industriellen, Stahlmagnaten und Philanthrop gegr\u00fcndet. In den n\u00e4chsten Jahren stieg die Zahl der Einwohner auf 4132 (im Jahr 1910), 6307 (im Jahr 1920), 7814 (im Jahr 1930) und 11. 842 (im Jahr 1940) weiter an.

Mai dieses Jahres wurde die Kommune und die Stadt Bonao zu Ehren des fr\u00fcheren Erzbischofs von Santo Domingo und Pr\u00e4sidenten in Monse\u00f1or Nouel umbenannt. 1960 erhielt die Stadt aber ihren urspr\u00fcnglichen Namen wieder. Die Stadt entstand in der N\u00e4he eines urspr\u00fcnglich von Christoph Kolumbus gegr\u00fcndeten Forts gleichen Namens. Wegen seiner Lage im Zentrum der Insel wurde das Gebiet der Provinz Monse\u00f1or Nouel im Vergleich zu anderen Regionen relativ sp\u00e4t besiedelt: Die ersten Menschen siedelten sich etwa um das Jahr 1000 vor Christus an; sie geh\u00f6rten zur Gruppe der \u201ebarreroides\u201c und waren Sammler, betrieben also keinen Ackerbau. Bei der Ankunft der Spanier geh\u00f6rte die Region zum Kaziken-Reich Magu\u00e1. Die Europ\u00e4er erreichten Bonao 1495, als die Spanier von Norden her ins Landesinnere vorstie\u00dfen und eine Reihe von Forts errichteten, eines davon Bonao. Bonao hatte in den ersten Jahren der Kolonisation eine gewisse Relevanz, da sich Francisco de Rold\u00e1n mit 70 Rebellen, die die Herrschaft der Br\u00fcder Kolumbus nicht anerkannten, hierhin zur\u00fcckzog. Die Anf\u00e4nge der Stadt Bonao gehen auf diese Rebellion zur\u00fcck, da einige der Teilnehmer nach deren Ende im Oktober 1498 hier zur\u00fcckblieben. Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas schrieb in seiner Historia de las Indias: \u201eAvecind\u00e1ronse algunos en el Bonao y se comenz\u00f3 all\u00ed la villa del Bonao\u201c. Dass die Stadt zu Zeiten von Kolumbus gegr\u00fcndet wurde, geht auch deutlich aus folgendem Absatz von Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo hervor (Historia General y Natural de las Indias): \u201e[. ] Don Crist\u00f3bal Colon, fizo e fund\u00f3 [. ] aquella primera poblaci\u00f3n de los treinta e ocho cristianos, donde qued\u00f3 por capit\u00e1n Rodrigo de Arana, la cual se llam\u00f3 la Navidada, fue el primer pueblo cat\u00f3lico en esta isla; y despu\u00e9s, en el segundo viaje que vino, fund\u00f3 la ciudad llamada isabela, cuando estuv\u00f3 del otro cabo deste r\u00edo; porque all\u00ed trajo la gente de la Isabela el adelantado don Bartolom\u00e9 Colon, hermano del dicho Almirante, como en otras partes est\u00e1 dicho.

Dezember 1508 erhielt Bonao offiziell das Stadtrecht und sein Wappen. Die wirtschaftliche Hauptaktivit\u00e4t war die Goldf\u00f6rderung, auch wenn die \u00f6rtlichen Minen nicht sehr gro\u00df waren. Als der Goldabbau dem Ende entgegen ging, errichtete man in Bonao Zuckerm\u00fchlen, wie der Bachiller Alonso de Parada in einem Bericht an Kaiser Karl V. beschreibt (aus dem Buch Santo Domingo en los Manuscritos de Juan Bautista Mu\u00f1oz, transkribiert von Roberto Marte): \u201eEl Bonao es tierra que lleva mucho fruto de pan i ma\u00edz, hanze comenzado a hacer en el dos engenios quel uno moldra presto\u201c."}

Der Ort wurde auch als \u201eCity of Dreams\u201c (Stadt der Tr\u00e4ume) bezeichnet, weil es in der spekulativen Boomphase zwischen 1870 und dem Ende des Jahrhunderts Hoffnungen weckte, hier k\u00f6nnte der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Pazifikhafen der USA entstehen. Doch mit der Wirtschaftskrise ab 1893, dem B\u00f6rsenkrach von 1893, brach der Boom mangels Kapital zusammen. Bis heute ist Port Townsend daher stark von dieser Bauphase gepr\u00e4gt. Ab 1897 wurde n\u00f6rdlich der Stadt das Fort Worden erbaut, eine K\u00fcstenbefestigung, die zusammen mit Fort Flagler und Fort Casey die Einfahrt in den Puget Sound f\u00fcr gegnerische Schiffe sperren sollte.

Der \u00f6konomische Niedergang bewirkte eine starke Abwanderung, so dass in den 1920er Jahren viele H\u00e4user leer standen.

Sie war nur wenige Kilometer lang und bef\u00f6rderte Granit aus dem Steinbruch in Quincy an die Ufer des Neponset River in Milton, wo er zum Weitertransport auf Schiffe umgeladen wurde. 1963 wurde der letzte Steinbruch stillgelegt. Ein weiteres Standbein der Stadt war der Segelschiffbau im 19. und beginnenden 20. Jahrhundert. Das s\u00fcd\u00f6stlich der Stadt liegende Gebiet am Fluss Weymouth Fore River wurde ab 1880 ein Zentrum des Schiffbaues. Die Fore River Ship and Engine Building Company, von Thomas A. Watson 1884 in Braintree gegr\u00fcndet, zog 1901 nach Quincy und baute viele Handels- und Kriegsschiffe, darunter den einzigen Siebenmastschoner Thomas W. Lawson, eines der gr\u00f6\u00dften Segelschiffe der Welthandelsflotte, den Flugzeugtr\u00e4ger USS Lexington (CV-2), die Schlachtschiffe USS Massachusetts (BB-59) und USS Nevada (BB-36) und die USS Salem (CA-139), Schwerer Kreuzer und der Welt letztes reines kanonenbest\u00fccktes Kriegsschiff. Es liegt als Museumsschiff des US-Marineschiffbaumuseums (United States Naval Ship Building Museum) am Pier. Die Werft wurde 1913 von Bethlehem Steel \u00fcbernommen und schloss die Tore nach hundertj\u00e4hriger Geschichte 1986."}

Die erste Siedlung Tena entstand vermutlich als Missionsposten der Jesuiten in der Amazonasregion um den 1560 gegr\u00fcndeten Ort Archidona. Die Region war seinerzeit von indigenen Gruppen, die unter der Bezeichnung Quijos zusammengefasst werden, bewohnt. Diese verweigerten sich der Kolonisierung und Missionierung durch die Spanier, mit der wirtschaftliche Ausbeutung und Nichtrespektierung traditioneller Heiligt\u00fcmer einherging. Unter ihrem Heerf\u00fchrer Jumandi griffen die Quijos in einer wohlorganisierten Aktion 1578 die Siedlung Archidona in der N\u00e4he Tenas an und zerst\u00f6rten sie v\u00f6llig, wobei alle Einwohner get\u00f6tet wurden. Lange konnte sich der Widerstand allerdings nicht halten, Jumandi wurde nach einem Angriff auf Baeza gefangengenommen und in Quito zu Tode gefoltert.

Beide Landkreise wurden aufgel\u00f6st und die Stadt umfasst damit die ganze Insel, sowie die gesamte Unterpr\u00e4fektur. Die wichtigsten Erwerbszweige sind Fischfang, Perlenfischerei und Tourismus. Tsushima ist durch F\u00e4hrverbindungen mit Hakata auf Ky\u016bsh\u016b und mit Busan in S\u00fcdkorea verbunden. Busan und Guam (US-amerikanische Insel der Marianen) sind Partnerst\u00e4dte von Tsushima. Izuhara, bei der Zusammenlegung aller Orte auf Tsushima 2004 mit rund 15 000 Einwohnern die gr\u00f6\u00dfte Stadt und Haupthafen der Insel, war 700 Jahre Burgstadt der F\u00fcrstenfamilie S\u014d.

Die Burg wurde 1669 renoviert. Erhalten ist in erster Linie die aus Bruchsteinen erbaute und von einem Wassergraben umgebene massive Burgmauer. Im Innern der Anlage fallen vor allem die Steine des Teiches des fr\u00fcheren Burggartens auf, von dem sonst nichts erhalten ist. Der Torturm der Burg wurde 1990 im Originalstil wieder errichtet.

Auch von der Bedeutung ihrer Funktion als Satellitenstadt war Seongnam eher zweitrangig im Vergleich zu anderen St\u00e4dten, wie Incheon, Gwacheon, Suwon und Anyang. Mit der Neuerrichtung des Stadtbezirks Bundang Anfang der 1990er Jahre nahm die Stadt einen v\u00f6llig anderen Charakter an. Die Einwohnerzahl verdoppelte sich, die Infrastruktur wurde erneuert und vor allem verschob sich die bisher mittelb\u00fcrgerliche Bev\u00f6lkerung zur oberen Gesellschaftsschicht. In den letzten Jahren gab es Bem\u00fchungen, Seongnam zu einer Gwangyeoksi (, Gro\u00dfstadt) zu machen. Damit w\u00fcrde es verwaltungstechnisch aus Gyeonggi-do herausgel\u00f6st und einer Provinz gleichgestellt. Begr\u00fcndet werden diese Bem\u00fchungen mit der wachsenden Bev\u00f6lkerung, die inzwischen die der Gro\u00dfstadt Ulsan \u00fcberstiegen hat, sowie der Tatsache, dass Seongnam sich langsam zu einer unabh\u00e4ngigen Stadt mit lokaler Industrie entwickelt.

Zus\u00e4tzliche Bedeutung erlangte die Stadt durch die Gr\u00fcndung des buddhistischen Tempels Narita-san Shinsh\u014d-ji im Jahre 940. W\u00e4hrend der Heian-Zeit war Narita der Mittelpunkt des Aufstandes des Samurai Taira no Masakado. In der Edo-Zeit begann Narita, als Teil des Tenry\u014d innerhalb der Provinz Shimousa unter direkter Kontrolle des Tokugawa-Shogunats, weiter aufzubl\u00fchen. Im April 1889, nach der Meiji-Restauration, wurde das Gebiet als Stadt unter die Verwaltung des Landkreises Imba gestellt. Im Laufe des Zweiten Weltkrieges wurden weite Teile der Stadt durch alliierte Luftangriffe im Mai 1945 besch\u00e4digt. Durch die Zusammenlegung im M\u00e4rz 1954 der D\u00f6rfer Habu, Nakago, Kuzumi, Toyosumi, Toyama und Kozu erhielt Narita den Stadtstatus.

Zun\u00e4chst begleitet von Demonstrationen und Widerstand, f\u00fchrte der Flughafen, dank des dadurch wachsenden Zugangs nach Tokyo zu einem ausgiebigen Wachstum der privaten, gewerblichen und industriellen Entwicklung der Stadt.

Die ersten Wei\u00dfen in der Region waren die Teilnehmer der Pike-Expedition, die 1806/07 die im Louisiana Purchase erworbenen Regionen erkundeten und um den Jahreswechsel den South Platte River erreichten und an ihm entlang zogen. Erst in den 1850er Jahren wurde die Region bedeutender. Einige Goldsucher, die auf dem California Trail auf dem Weg zum Kalifornischen Goldrausch waren, erkundeten unterwegs die erste Bergkette der Rocky Mountains. 1858 fanden William Green Russell und 12 Kollegen Gold am Little Dry Creek und gr\u00fcndeten ein Goldgr\u00e4ber-Camp an der M\u00fcndung des Bachs in den South Platte River im heutigen Stadtgebiet von Englewood. Sie waren erfolgreich und der Colorado Gold Rush begann. 1864 meldeten Thomas und Mary Skerritt einen Anspruch auf ein Siedlungsgrundst\u00fcck nach dem Homestead Act an, das einen gro\u00dfen Teil der heutigen Stadt umfasste. In den folgenden Jahren kamen weitere Siedler, die Grundst\u00fccke wurden geteilt, verkauft, wieder geteilt und bis etwa 1880 waren drei Siedlungskerne Petersburg, Cherrelyn und Orchard Place, sowie mehrere Streusiedlungen entstanden. Die landwirtschaftliche Basis stellten vorwiegend Obstplantagen dar, die die wesentlich schneller und gr\u00f6\u00dfer gewachsene Stadt Denver versorgten. Thomas Skerritt selbst baute die erste direkte Stra\u00dfe dorthin aus, die wegen ihrer Breite den Namen Broadway bekam und bis heute tr\u00e4gt. 1890 wurde die Region an das Eisenbahnnetz angeschlossen. 1903 beschlossen die Siedlungen sich zusammenzuschlie\u00dfen und eine Verwaltungseinheit mit politischer Selbstverwaltung zu gr\u00fcnden. Sie bekam den Namen Englewood wegen des hohen Waldanteils, der das Gebiet von der umliegenden Pr\u00e4rie und den Halbw\u00fcsten unterschied. Schon seit 1892 gab es eine Schule, in den n\u00e4chsten Jahren folgten ein Krankenhaus, mehrere Theater und eine Stra\u00dfenbahn. Es siedelten sich Industriebetriebe an, darunter 1923 Alexander Industries, ein kleiner Hersteller von Flugzeugen, und 1924 General Iron Works, deren Stahlwerk bis zum Niedergang der Stahlindustrie in Colorado und der Schlie\u00dfung 1985 der wichtigste Arbeitgeber der Stadt war. Die Stadt hat heute eine sehr kleinteilige Wirtschaftsstruktur. Sie hat mehr Arbeitspl\u00e4tze und Unternehmen pro Fl\u00e4cheneinheit als alle anderen Orte der Rocky-Mountains-Region von Colorado, dabei bleibt sie im Durchschnittseinkommen deutlich hinter dem Durchschnitt der Metropolregion Denver zur\u00fcck.

Villa Carlos Paz wurde 1914 von dem Gro\u00dfgrundbesitzer Carlos Nicandro Paz gegr\u00fcndet, kurz nachdem in der N\u00e4he der Staudamm San Roque errichtet worden war, der die Millionenstadt C\u00f3rdoba mit Trinkwasser und Energie beliefert. Bereits nach wenigen Jahren wurde Carlos Paz zu einem bedeutenden Touristenzentrum, die Einwohnerzahl wuchs sehr schnell an. Heute ist Carlos Paz auch zur Schlafstadt der Provinzhauptstadt geworden, zu deren Ballungsraum es geh\u00f6rt. Carlos Paz ist vor allem als Fremdenverkehrszentrum bekannt, wo es in der nationalen Statistik Rang drei hinter Mar del Plata und Bariloche einnimmt. Etwa zwei Millionen Touristen besuchen die Stadt pro Jahr. In der Umgebung kann man baden, wandern, kajakfahren, segeln und gleitschirmfliegen. F\u00fcr Familien gibt es Freizeitparks und einen Sessellift auf den Cerro La Cruz. Ein weiterer Anziehungspunkt ist das Nachtleben mit mehreren Theatern, Casinos und Diskotheken, in die sich im Sommer ein Gro\u00dfteil der Szene von C\u00f3rdoba verlagert. Im Sommer gibt es diverse Veranstaltungen in Carlos Paz, unter anderem Konzerte und Festivals aller Art. Das gr\u00f6\u00dfte Ereignis im Jahr ist jedoch der Rallye-Weltmeisterschaftslauf im Mai oder Juni, der Zehntausende Schaulustige anlockt. Das bedingungslose Wachstum des Tourismus und gleichzeitig der permanenten Wohnbev\u00f6lkerung in der Stadt hat zu einer Reihe \u00f6kologischer Probleme gef\u00fchrt. Am gravierendsten ist das der Wasserknappheit: Da der Trinkwasserspender der Stadt, der Fluss R\u00edo San Antonio, im trockenen Winterhalbjahr wenig Wasser f\u00fchrt, reicht sein Wasservolumen inzwischen nicht mehr aus, um den Stausee befriedigend zu f\u00fcllen und gleichzeitig den Wasserbedarf der st\u00e4ndig wachsenden Bev\u00f6lkerung zu decken. Die Folge sind Zwangsrationierungen insbesondere im Fr\u00fchjahr und Fischsterben im See. Weiterhin ist die Verschmutzung des Sees und des Flusses bereits soweit fortgeschritten, das in einem Radius von zehn Kilometern um die Stadt nicht mehr gebadet werden kann."}

Der Handelsweg, die Benennung nach einem Gr\u00fcnder namens Hildwin, aber auch andere Thesen f\u00fcr den Ursprung des Namens werden genannt. Dabei ist die Namensentwicklung zu beachten (Zitat Brockhaus Multimedia 2002): \u201eDer Name Hildesheim (so seit Anfang des 13. Jahrhunderts) ist verk\u00fcrzt aus Hildinisheim (12. Jahrhundert), Hildeneshem (1022) und Hiltenesheim (1004) hervorgegangen. Er enth\u00e4lt den alten deutschen Personennamen Hildin oder Hildini (zu althochdeutsch hiltia, Kampf)\u201c. Die Schreibung Hiltinesheim entspricht der althochdeutschen, die Form Hildeneshem der alts\u00e4chsischen Form des Namens. Urspr\u00fcnglicher Namenstr\u00e4ger war m\u00f6glicherweise die \u00e4lteste Siedlung im heutigen Stadtgebiet, das Alte Dorf, von der die sp\u00e4ter gegr\u00fcndete Stadt den Namen \u00fcbernahm. Historisch wurde Hildesheim auch beim lateinischen Namen genannt: Hildesia. Ausgrabungen, die direkt nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg auf dem Hildesheimer Annenfriedhof durchgef\u00fchrt wurden, weisen darauf hin, dass sich schon im 8.

Diese Mitglieder der Kirche Jesu Christi der Heiligen der Letzten Tage (HLT, englisch Latter-day Saints, LDS), auch Mormonen genannt, waren haupts\u00e4chlich wegen der religi\u00f6sen Verfolgung und Diskriminierung in den \u00f6stlichen Staaten geflohen. Sie waren die ersten Wei\u00dfen, die sich in Utah niederlie\u00dfen. Nach dem Lynchmord an ihrem Kirchengr\u00fcnder Joseph Smith leitete der zweite Kirchenpr\u00e4sident Brigham Young die Mehrheit der Kirchenmitglieder in Richtung Westen \u2013 das Gebiet der Stadt geh\u00f6rte damals offiziell noch zu Mexiko, war aber praktisch ein Niemandsland; so hoffte man, aus dem Gebiet der als feindlich empfundenen USA zu entkommen. Letztlich gelang dies zwar nicht, aber bis die US-Zentralmacht hier merklich in Erscheinung treten konnte, waren die Mormonen bereits fest genug etabliert, um in ihrer Existenz nicht mehr gef\u00e4hrdet zu sein. Berichten zufolge hatte Young bei der Ankunft im Salt Lake Tal eine Vision, die besagte: Dies ist der richtige Ort. Urspr\u00fcnglich hie\u00df sie Great Salt Lake City, wurde allerdings umbenannt, als sie Hauptstadt des Gebiets wurde. Im Jahr 2002 war Salt Lake City Austragungsort der Olympischen Winterspiele und 2004 Austragungsort der World Sledge Hockey Championships. Die Stadt liegt in einem gro\u00dfen Tal, dem Salt Lake Valley, das von der Wasatchkette im Osten und dem Oquirrh-Gebirge im Westen eingeschlossen wird. Wie die meisten St\u00e4dte, die sich n\u00f6rdlich und s\u00fcdlich von Salt Lake City erstrecken (wie Ogden und Provo) liegt es am Fu\u00dfe der Wasatchkette, die sich an manchen Stellen 2000 Meter \u00fcber dem Tal erhebt. Dieses st\u00e4dtische Gebiet ist auch als die Wasatch Front bekannt. Salt Lake City liegt in der semiariden Klimazone mit ausgepr\u00e4gten Sommern und Wintern. Fr\u00fchling und Herbst kommen fast gar nicht zur Geltung. So ist es im Sommer trocken und hei\u00df und im Winter ist die Stadt vom Schnee gepr\u00e4gt. Das Oquirrh-Gebirge an der Stadt ist eher kahl, w\u00e4hrend an der Wasatchkette auch Nadelb\u00e4ume wachsen. Das Winterklima ist wegen des ausgleichenden Effekts des Gro\u00dfen Salzsees nicht so rau wie \u00f6stlich der Rocky Mountains in Cheyenne oder Denver. Die Temperaturen fallen selten l\u00e4ngere Zeit unter \u221218 \u00b0C. Das Sommerklima ist ebenfalls durch den See gem\u00e4\u00dfigt, dazu kommt die Lage der Stadt auf etwa 1350 Meter. Durchschnittlich etwa achtmal im Jahr werden 38 \u00b0C \u00fcberschritten, diese Tage sind allerdings nicht so unangenehm, da es sich um eines der trockensten Gebiete des Landes handelt."}

Die ersten Wei\u00dfen am Utah Lake waren die Angeh\u00f6rigen der Dominguez-Escalante-Expedition zweier spanischer Franziskaner-Patres 1776. In den 1820er Jahren kamen Pelzj\u00e4ger und -h\u00e4ndler in die Gegend und hielten sich als erste Wei\u00dfe l\u00e4nger vor Ort auf. Die ersten Siedler nannten ihren Ort und den aus den Bergen kommenden Bach Hobble Creek, weil sie ihre Pferde im Bachtal nur locker hobbeln mussten und keine Pferche bauten. Nur drei Jahre nach der ersten Ansiedlung wurde die Siedlung als incorporated city im Jahr 1853 eingetragen und damit zur selbst\u00e4ndigen Stadt. Der Name wurde in der Folge in das heutige Springville ge\u00e4ndert, nach den vielen Hangquellen. Hobble Creek blieb jedoch der Name des Baches, des Canyons, in dem der Bach aus den Bergen hervortritt, und heute auch des Golfplatzes, der um das Quellgebiet entstand. Der kleine Hobble Creek bot aber nicht genug Wasser f\u00fcr die geplante Gr\u00f6\u00dfe der Siedlung, nur relativ wenige Farmen konnten auf dem guten, aber zu trockenen Boden existieren. Daher wichen einige Bewohner auf Ranching aus und bauten Rinder- und Schafherden auf. Sie \u00fcbernutzten die Weidel\u00e4nder im Hobble Creek Canyon, die Vegetationsdecke wurde zerst\u00f6rt und das Erdreich der Erosion ausgesetzt. Es folgten \u00dcberschwemmungen der Siedlungsgebiete unterhalb der Berge, die einen lang andauernden Konflikt zwischen Farmern und Ranchern ausl\u00f6sten. 1902 wurde die Angelegenheit vom US-Landwirtschaftsministerium untersucht und die Berge oberhalb der Stadt unter die Verwaltung des noch jungen United States Forest Service gestellt. Infolge des Konfliktes mit den Ranchern wandelte sich auch der Ackerbau im Ort. Die Bewohner von Springville nutzten neue F\u00f6rderungsm\u00f6glichkeiten von Bew\u00e4sserungssystemen durch die Bundesregierung und stellten wie andere Siedlungen im Utah Valley weitgehend auf den Anbau von Obst einerseits und Zuckerr\u00fcben andererseits um. F\u00fcr die Bew\u00e4sserung wurde Energie ben\u00f6tigt, weshalb 1904 das erste kleine Wasserkraftwerk im Hobble Creek Canyon erbaut wurde. Es wurde seitdem mehrfach erweitert und versorgt bis heute die Stadt mit Strom. Bereits 1856 hatten einige der Siedler die landwirtschaftlichen Fl\u00e4chen nach S\u00fcden erweitert und rodeten das so genannte Union Field. Aufgrund von sporadischen Konflikten mit den Indianern wurde es aber erst im gr\u00f6\u00dferen Ma\u00dfe genutzt, nachdem die Ute 1869 in ein Indianerreservat gezwungen worden waren. Die zweite Siedlung auf dem Gebiet von Springville wuchs langsam und erhielt 1901 im Zusammenhang mit der Anlage eines Bew\u00e4sserungssystems die Unabh\u00e4ngigkeit als Mapleton."}

Etwa 25 Kilometer nordwestlich liegt Esbjerg, 50 Kilometer \u00f6stlich liegt Kolding. Das Stadtgebiet umfasst 352 km\u00b2. Der Name geht auf das altd\u00e4nische Wort ripa zur\u00fcck, das f\u00fcr den Plural von Streifen steht. Erkl\u00e4rt wird diese Bezeichnung mit der Ver\u00e4stelung des Handelsweges, der hier den Fluss an seiner M\u00fcndung kreuzte. Als der Missionar Ansgar von Bremen im Jahr 860 einen Platz f\u00fcr die erste in Skandinavien zu errichtende Kirche suchte, fiel seine Wahl auf Ribe. Kein Zufall, denn die Stadt war schon damals der bedeutendste Handelsort des Nordens, bedingt durch den guten Hafen und den schiffbaren Fluss. So ist die Bitte Ansgars an K\u00f6nig Horik II. zwar die erste Erw\u00e4hnung der Stadt, arch\u00e4ologisch l\u00e4sst sie sich aber bis ins 8. Jahrhundert zur\u00fcckverfolgen. Wie die Funde belegen, war die Stadt damals von Handwerk gepr\u00e4gt (Metallgie\u00dferei, Lederverarbeitung, Webarbeiten, T\u00f6pferei). Schon in fr\u00fchester Zeit muss sie Handelsverbindungen nach Norddeutschland und England gehabt haben, insbesondere nach Stade, Bremen, K\u00f6ln, Br\u00fcgge, Deventer, Groningen und Utrecht. Eine intakte Kleeblattkanne wurde 2015 auf dem Friedhof von Ribe ausgegraben. Der etwa 1000 Jahre alte Krug wurde in Frankreich oder Belgien produziert und ist der erste derartige Fund in D\u00e4nemark. Zwar soll Ribe 1043 von den Abodriten gepl\u00fcndert worden sein, und zwischen 1176 und 1402 zerst\u00f6rten sieben Brandkatastrophen gro\u00dfe Teile der Stadt, doch die Stadt erholte sich von diesen R\u00fcckschl\u00e4gen ebenso wie von der Pest, die 1350 in Ribe w\u00fctete und von zwei schweren \u00dcberschwemmungen, der Zweiten Marcellusflut von 1362 und der Sturmflut von 1512. So lebten Ende des 15. Jahrhunderts etwa 5000 Menschen in Ribe, womit es zu den gr\u00f6\u00dferen St\u00e4dten in Nordeuropa z\u00e4hlte (zum Vergleich: Hamburg hatte etwa 10. 000, L\u00fcbeck etwa 25. 000 Einwohner). 1460 wurde in der Stadt der Vertrag von Ripen abgeschlossen, der die Unteilbarkeit Schleswigs und Holsteins best\u00e4tigen sollte, vor 1496 baute die Gemeinde das Alte Rathaus."}

Der Ort wurde circa 1305 im Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis (Zehntregister des Bistums Breslau) erstmals urkundlich als zwei Siedlungen erw\u00e4hnt: Chotowitz theutonico (Deutsch Chotowice) wurde vermutlich auf Deutschen Recht (iure theuthonico) auf Grunde Chotowitz polonico (Polnisch Chotowice) gegr\u00fcndet, das wurde fr\u00fcher (es m\u00f6chte schon hoche Zehnte zahlen) auf \u00e4lteren traditionellen polnischen Recht (iure polonico) entstanden. Im Jahre 1404 wurde das Dorf erstmals als Czechowicz[e] (staat Chatowice) erw\u00e4hnt. Beide Namen waren patronymisch mit typischen patronymischen Wortende -ice. Die erste Name (Chotowice) war abgeleitet vom Vorname Chot (\u2264 Chociemir, Chocies\u0142aw) und die zweite vom Vorname Czech (\u2264 Czes\u0142aw). Der Grund f\u00fcr die Namens\u00e4nderung ist nicht klar. Die Pfarrei Czechowicz im Teschener Dekanat wurde im Peterspfennigregister des Jahres 1447 erw\u00e4hnt. Dziedzice wurde erstmals im Jahr 1465 als Dziedzicz[e] erw\u00e4hnt. Der name Dziedzice ist auch patronymisch abgeleitet vom Vorname Dziad. Politisch geh\u00f6rten sie urspr\u00fcnglich zum Herzogtum Teschen, dieses bestand ab 1290 in der Zeit. Seit 1327 bestand die Lehensherrschaft des K\u00f6nigreichs B\u00f6hmen, seit 1526 geh\u00f6rte es zur Habsburgermonarchie. Die Entwicklung beider Orte zu Industriestandorten erfolgte um die Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts. Dzieditz erhielt durch die Errichtung der \u00d6sterreichischen Nordbahn von Wien nach Krakau in den Jahren 1847 bis 1855 eine Eisenbahnstation und wurde zum Ausgangspunkt f\u00fcr die Anschlussstrecken nach Bielitz (1855) und nach Kattowitz (1870).

Die Geschichte des Ortes geht auf die zweite H\u00e4lfte des 16. Jahrhunderts zur\u00fcck, als Kosaken 1569 die Stadt gr\u00fcndeten. Anfangs war Aksai ein Milit\u00e4rst\u00fctzpunkt in einem der s\u00fcdlichen Grenzgebiete Russlands und musste mehrmals Angriffe abwehren, unter anderem seitens der Krimtataren. Im sp\u00e4ten 17.

Jahrhundert hatte Aksai noch milit\u00e4rische Bedeutung, als hier im Krimkrieg eine Verteidigungslinie positioniert war. In den 1860er-Jahren wurde der Ort an das russische Eisenbahnnetz angeschlossen, was zu einem Bev\u00f6lkerungswachstum f\u00fchrte. Schon seit der Ortsgr\u00fcndung wurde hier aufgrund der fruchtbaren B\u00f6den und des f\u00fcr russische Verh\u00e4ltnisse warmen Klimas Landwirtschaft betrieben.

Januar 1319 durch K\u00f6nig Ludwig IV. zur Stadt erhoben, erhielt einen Wochenmarkt und wurde mit dem Stadtrecht nach dem Vorbild von Eger ausgestattet. Unter dem Abt Franz K\u00fcbel wurde es zusammen mit dem umgebenden Sch\u00f6nbacher L\u00e4ndchen 1348 vom Kloster Waldsassen dem Burggrafen R\u00fcdiger von Sparneck verkauft. Vor allem um das 16.

Im Norden des Beckens erheben sich die Berge des Yangmingshan-Nationalparks mit dem Qixing Shan als h\u00f6chster Erhebung (1. 120 m). Dort kann man vulkanische Aktivit\u00e4ten erleben sowie die Kirschbl\u00fcte, Schmetterlinge und Graslandschaften bestaunen.

Zwischen 1626 und 1642 errichtete Spanien vereinzelte St\u00fctzpunkte im Norden Taiwans, wurde jedoch von den Niederl\u00e4ndern vertrieben. 1662 wurden die Holl\u00e4nder von Zheng Chenggong (Koxinga) besiegt, dessen Erben die Kontrolle \u00fcber Taiwan jedoch Ende des 17. Jahrhunderts an die Qing-Dynastie verloren. Erst danach begann die Besiedlung Nordtaiwans durch chinesische Einwanderer. Schritt f\u00fcr Schritt zogen die Chinesen nach Norden. Das Gebiet am Danshui-Fluss wurde das wichtigste Zentrum in Nordtaiwan und die chinesischen Siedlungen Mon-Jia (, m\u011bngji\u01ce, heute Wanhua , W\u00e0nhu\u00e1), Dalongdong, Dadaocheng entwickelten sich zu Gesch\u00e4ftszentren. Diese drei Siedlungen stellten mit ihrer Entwicklung die Keimzelle f\u00fcr das sich entwickelnde Taipeh dar. Taipehs Entwicklung als Stadt begann 1709, als Chen-Lai-Zhang, eine Vereinigung von Zuwanderern aus Quanzhou, Fujian, von der Regierung die Erlaubnis zur Urbarmachung des Gebietes bekam. Die erste Ansiedlung war ein am Ostufer des Danshui gelegenes Handelsdorf mit einem Hafen namens Manga (taiwanische Lesung; chin. , m\u011bngji\u01ce), heute Wanhua, wo sich auch der ab 1738 errichtete Longshan-Tempel (Drachenbergtempel, , L\u00f3ngsh\u0101n s\u00ec) befindet. Zu Beginn der 1870er Jahre wurde mit dem Ausbau Taipehs zur Gro\u00dfstadt begonnen."}

Die Stadt Kamen am Ob ist der Region administrativ direkt unterstellt und zugleich Verwaltungszentrum des Rajons Kamen. Bei Kamen \u00fcberquert die Eisenbahnstrecke Omsk \u2013 Karassuk \u2013 Nowoaltaisk (\u2013 Barnaul), auch Mittelsibirische Eisenbahn genannt, den Ob. Es gibt einen Flusshafen. Am s\u00fcd\u00f6stlichen Stadtrand beginnt der Kulunda-Magistralkanal. Das Dorf Kamen entstand 1751 (nach anderen Angaben bereits 1670) und entwickelte sich bis Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts zu einem der besonders f\u00fcr den Getreidehandel wichtigsten D\u00f6rfer des damaligen Ujesds (Kreises) Barnaul des Gouvernements Tomsk. 1915 (nach anderen Angaben erst 1925) wurde dem Ort der Stadtstatus verliehen. Seit 1933 ist der Zusatz am Ob (-na-Obi) offizieller Bestandteil des Ortsnamens. Nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg wurde die Stadt weiter als Zentrum eines wichtigen Landwirtschaftsgebietes ausgebaut. In der Mitte der 1960er Jahre erhielt Kamen Eisenbahnanschluss. Zwischen 1973 und 1983 wurde der hier beginnende Kulunda-Magistralkanal zur Bew\u00e4sserung der Steppen westlich des Ob errichtet, 1979 das gr\u00f6\u00dfte Getreidesilo der Sowjetunion jenseits des Ural. Die Hauptsehensw\u00fcrdigkeiten der Stadt gruppieren sich entlang der etwa drei Kilometer langen heutigen Leninstra\u00dfe, welche von ehemaligen Markt- oder Basarplatz zum Flusshafen am Ob f\u00fchrt. Auf einer Anh\u00f6he liegt hier die Kirche zur Erscheinung des Herrn (russ. / zerkow Bogojawlenija Gospodnja, oder kurz / Bogojawlenski chram). Die Kirche im Pseudorussischen Stil wurde 1902 geweiht, seit den 1930er Jahren als Spirituosenfabrik genutzt und stark in Mitleidenschaft gezogen, aber nach 1990 wieder an die Russisch-Orthodoxe Kirche zur\u00fcckgegeben."}

Unter den Herren von Ludanitz wurde Chropyn\u011b zum Herrschaftssitz einer kleinen Herrschaft. In dieser Zeit entstand eine Gemeinde der B\u00f6hmischen Br\u00fcder, die eine Schule unterhielt. 1535 erteilte Kaiser Ferdinand I. Chropyn\u011b die Marktrechte. 1567 verkaufte die Familie von Ludanitz die Herrschaft an Vratislav von Pernstein, der sie noch im selben Jahr mit Hans und Adam von Haugwitz auf Biskupitz gegen das Gut Litomy\u0161l eintauschte. Zu dieser Zeit entstanden die Fischteiche und Chropyn\u011b wurde bekannt f\u00fcr seine Fischzucht. Obwohl die Haugwitz im Gegensatz zu den reformierten Ludanitzern Katholiken waren, war die Zeit ihrer Herrschaft von Toleranz gegen\u00fcber den B\u00f6hmischen Br\u00fcdern gekennzeichnet. 1579 begann der Landeshauptmann von M\u00e4hren Hans von Haugwitz mit dem Bau der neuen Feste Neu Haugwitz (Nov\u00fd Haugvicov), f\u00fcr deren Errichtung ihm zwei Jahre zuvor Kaiser Rudolf II. seine Zustimmung erteilt hatte. Als der schwarze Haugwitz, wie er genannt wurde, 1580 starb, blieb der Bau unvollendet und ab 1581 wechselten die Besitzer der Herrschaft Chropin in rascher Folge. Im Jahre 1615 kaufte Bischof Franz Seraph von Dietrichstein die Herrschaft Chropin f\u00fcr das Bistum Olm\u00fctz und gab daf\u00fcr die Herrschaft \u017d\u010f\u00e1r nad S\u00e1zavou in Zahlung.

Im 13. Jahrhundert bildete sich unweit davon ein Handelsplatz, der noch vor 1300 zur Stadt erhoben wurde. Da Mittelniederdeutsch die Kaufmannssprache war, \u00e4nderte sich der Name zu Apenrade, die noch heute gebr\u00e4uchliche deutsche Bezeichnung. Die s\u00e4chsische Endung \u201eRade\u201c im Sinne von Rodung ist sonst im Schleswiger Land nur im \u00e4u\u00dfersten S\u00fcdosten bekannt, in Holstein aber verbreitet. Es wird angenommen, dass die Schreibform Apenrade urspr\u00fcnglich eine deutsche Volksetymologie war, weil die Ortsnamenendung -rade auf Holsteiner Plattdeutsch als /ra:/ oder /r\u00e5:/ ausgesprochen wird. Noch in den 1850er Jahren, als sich die Verwaltung des Gesamtstaats unter der d\u00e4nischen Krone um eine St\u00e4rkung des D\u00e4nischen bem\u00fchte, war Apenrade die einzig g\u00e4ngige schriftliche Namensform. Die Form \u00c5benr\u00e5 war aber in der gesprochenen d\u00e4nischen Umgangssprache \u00fcblich; so hei\u00dft eine Kopenhagener Stra\u00dfe, urspr\u00fcnglich namens \u00c5benrad (offene (H\u00e4user)reihe), seit ungef\u00e4hr 1600 \u00c5benr\u00e5, da man durch Volksetymologie angenommen hat, dass es sich um den Stadtnamen handelte. Im Zuge des nationalen Konflikts wurde von d\u00e4nischen Kulturk\u00e4mpfern nach den 1840er und 1850er Jahren der Stadtname Aabenraa in die Schriftsprache eingef\u00fchrt. Im d\u00e4nischen Sprachgebrauch setzte sich diese Bezeichnung nach der Trennung Schleswigs von D\u00e4nemark 1864 durch und wurde 1920 nach dem Anschluss Nordschleswigs die offizielle Bezeichnung der Stadt. Der heutige Name Aabenraa ist somit ein sehr seltenes Beispiel einer danisierten, urspr\u00fcnglich deutschen Schreibweise, die jedoch ihrerzeit den d\u00e4nischen Namen Opneraa ersetzte. Vergleichbar ist Nordborg, das nach d\u00e4nischer Sprachtradition eigentlich N\u00f8rborg oder N\u00f8rreborg hei\u00dfen m\u00fcsste; vereinzelte Bem\u00fchungen, den Namen N\u00f8rborg einzuf\u00fchren, scheiterten aber. Bei den meisten schleswigschen Ortsnamen ist das Gegenteil der Fall: Eingedeutschte Namen d\u00e4nischen Ursprungs (heute im deutschen Teil Schleswigs, 1864\u20131920 auch in Nordschleswig). Die d\u00e4nische Rechtschreibreform von 1948 machte aus aa ein \u00e5, da ein doppeltes A im D\u00e4nischen kein langes A, sondern ein offenes O repr\u00e4sentiert. W\u00e4hrend Aarhus sich schnell mit der Schreibreform zufrieden erkl\u00e4rte, gab es in Aalborg und Aabenraa starken Widerstand. Die Folge war, dass der Stadtname in alphabetischen Listen nun vom ersten auf den hintersten Platz rutschte, denn \u00c5 ist der letzte Buchstabe im d\u00e4nischen Alphabet. Auch in internationalen Verzeichnissen w\u00fcrde die Stadt von \u201eAabenraa\u201c auf \u201eAbenra\u201c absinken. Nicht zuletzt deshalb konnte sich die Schreibweise \u00c5benr\u00e5 in der F\u00f6rdestadt nie durchsetzen. Der neue Buchstabe wurde popul\u00e4r auch \u201ebolle-\u00e5\u201c genannt (\u201ebolle\u201c = Kugel, Zirkel) und wurde nach schwedischem Muster eingef\u00fchrt. Der sprachkonservative Verein Dansk Sprogv\u00e6rn stattete die Aabenraaer in den 1950er Jahren mit Plakaten und Aufklebern mit folgendem Reim aus: Byens Navn er Aabenraa \u2013 uden svenske Boller paa!(Der Name der Stadt ist Aabenraa \u2013 ohne schwedische Zirkel/Kl\u00f6\u00dfe drauf!) Ende der 1990er Jahre gab es eine politische Bewegung mit dem B\u00fcrgermeister an der Spitze: Aabenraa? Ganz vorne! Seit einem Ministererlass aus dem Jahr 1984 sind lokal bevorzugte Schreibweisen wie Aabenraa und Aalborg wieder zugelassen."}

Von den Anf\u00e4ngen der Geschichte des Ortes kann man ab etwa 1163 sprechen, als das Gebiet als Teil des Herzogtums Oppeln nachgewiesen ist. Die erste urkundliche Erw\u00e4hnung als Dobrosin stammt aus dem Jahre 1279. F\u00fcr 1300 ist die Namensform Dobradin \u00fcberliefert. Nach dem Aussterben der piastischen Herzogslinie im Jahre 1327 kamen das gesamte Oppelner Land und die Stadt Guttentag durch Erbfolgerecht an B\u00f6hmen. Das Stadtrecht erhielt Dobradin 1384 nach Magdeburger Recht. Aus dieser Zeit stammt auch das Wappen der Stadt, das in den wesentlichen Z\u00fcgen auch heute noch besteht. Mit B\u00f6hmen ging die Stadt 1526 an Habsburg \u00fcber. 1574 wurde der Ort als Dobrodzin erw\u00e4hnt und 1636 tauchte Guttentag auf. Nach der endg\u00fcltigen Entscheidung in den Schlesischen Kriegen, 1742 zum Nachteil der Habsburger, wurde Guttentag Teil Preu\u00dfens und 1816 dem Kreis Lublinitz im schlesischen Regierungsbezirk Oppeln zugeordnet und diente neben der Stadt Lublinitz auch als Garnisonsort f\u00fcr die preussische Armee. Am Pfingstmontag des Jahres 1846 w\u00fctete ein verheerendes Feuer in Guttentag, das zahlreiche Geb\u00e4ude zerst\u00f6rte. Auch die Pfarrkirche wurde ein Opfer der Flammen.

In der Volksabstimmung in Oberschlesien 1921 \u00fcber die weitere staatliche Zugeh\u00f6rigkeit wurden in Guttentag 1664 Stimmen (79,5 %) f\u00fcr den Verbleib bei Deutschland und 430 Stimmen (20,5 %) f\u00fcr den Anschluss an Polen abgegeben. Auch wenn der gesamte Stimmkreis Lublinitz mit knapper Mehrheit f\u00fcr Deutschland gestimmt hatte, fiel der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Teil an Polen; Guttentag blieb dagegen deutsch und wurde darauf Kreisstadt eines neuen Landkreises Guttentag.

Im Jahre 1347 erhielt Rumburg das Stadtrecht.

Dank ihrer strategisch g\u00fcnstigen Lage am Kreuzungspunkt mehrerer Karawanenwege, die \u00c4gypten mit Syrien und S\u00fcdarabien mit dem Mittelmeer verbanden, war die Stadt vom 5. Jahrhundert vor bis zum 3. Jahrhundert n. Chr. ein bedeutender Handelsplatz. Insbesondere kontrollierte Petra einen wichtigen Knotenpunkt der Weihrauchstra\u00dfe. Diese uralte Handelsroute f\u00fchrte vom Jemen aus an der Westk\u00fcste Arabiens entlang und teilte sich bei Petra in einen nordwestlichen Zweig, der nach Gaza und in einen nord\u00f6stlichen, der nach Damaskus f\u00fchrte. Zur verkehrstechnisch g\u00fcnstigen Lage kamen die Vorteile der besonderen Topographie. Zum einen liegt Petra versteckt und gut gesch\u00fctzt zwischen schroffen Felsw\u00e4nden. Der Ort ist nur \u00fcber einen schmalen Gebirgspfad von Nordwesten zug\u00e4nglich oder von Osten her durch eine etwa 1,5 Kilometer lange und etwa 70 Meter tiefe Felsschlucht, den Siq (dt. : \u201eSchacht\u201c), der an seiner engsten Stelle nur 2 Meter breit ist. Zum anderen verf\u00fcgte Petra in der Antike \u00fcber eine sichere Wasserversorgung. Brauch- und Trinkwasser wurden \u00fcber in den Fels gemei\u00dfelte Aqu\u00e4dukte in die Stadt geleitet sowie durch Terrakottar\u00f6hren, die ebenfalls in die Felsw\u00e4nde eingelassen und mit Gips abgedichtet waren. Das h\u00f6chst komplexe Wasserversorgungssystem, das mehr als 200 Zisternen umfasste, speiste sich aus allen bekannten Wasserquellen im Umkreis von mehr als 25 Kilometern um die Stadt. Die enge Verbindung von Fels und Wasser in der Region lie\u00df die Legende entstehen, Petra sei der Ort gewesen, an dem Mose beim Exodus des Volkes Israel aus \u00c4gypten mit dem Schlag seines Stabes eine Quelle aus dem Stein habe sprudeln lassen. Die Region um Petra tr\u00e4gt daher den Namen Wadi Musa (dt. : \u201eMosestal\u201c).

The Nunamiut traded with the coastal people for other items they needed. A decline in caribou populations in about 1900 and in the 1920s caused many Nunamiut to move to the coastal villages. In 1938, several families of Nunamiut moved back to the Brooks Range, around Tulugak and the Killik River. In 1949 the Tulugak group moved to Anaktuvuk Pass and later the Killik River group moved there also. Anaktuvuk Pass is the only Nunamiut settlement.

Their descendants now occupy the Cocopah and Quechan reservations. In 1540, Spanish colonial expeditions under Hernando de Alarcon and Melchior Diaz visited the area and immediately recognized the natural crossing of the Colorado River as an ideal spot for a city. The Colorado River narrows to slightly under 1,000 feet wide in one area. Military expeditions that crossed the Colorado River at the Yuma Crossing include Juan Bautista de Anza (1774), the Mormon Battalion (1848) and the California Column (1862). During and after the California Gold Rush to the late 1870s, the Yuma Crossing was known for its ferry crossings for the Southern Emigrant Trail. This was considered the gateway to California, as it was one of the few natural spots where travelers could cross the otherwise very wide Colorado River. Following the United States establishing Fort Yuma, two towns developed one mile down river. The one on the California side was called Jaeger City, named after the owner of Jaeger's Ferry, which crossed the river there. It was for a time the larger of the two, with the Butterfield Overland Mail office and station, two blacksmiths, a hotel, two stores, and other dwellings. The other was called Colorado City. Developed on the south side of the river in what is now Arizona by speculator Charles Poston, it was the site of the custom house. When started, it was just north of the border between Mexican-ruled Sonora, Mexico and California. After the Gadsden Purchase by the United States, the town bordered on the Territory of New Mexico. This area was designated as the Territory of Arizona in 1863. The Colorado City site at the time was duly registered in San Diego; both banks of the Colorado River just below its confluence with the Gila were recognized as being within the jurisdiction of California. The county of San Diego collected taxes from there for many years. From 1853 a smaller settlement, Arizona City, grew up on the high ground across from the fort and was organized under the name of its post office in 1858. It had adobe dwellings, two stores and two saloons. Colorado City and Jaeger City were almost completely destroyed by the Great Flood of 1862 and had to be rebuilt on higher ground."}

A Phoenician commercial outpost called Ikosim which later developed into a small Roman town called Icosium existed on what is now the marine quarter of the city. The rue de la Marine follows the lines of what used to be a Roman street. Roman cemeteries existed near Bab-el-Oued and Bab Azoun. The city was given Latin rights by Emperor Vespasian. The bishops of Icosium are mentioned as late as the 5th century. The present-day city was founded in 944 by Bologhine ibn Ziri, the founder of the Berber Zirid\u2013Sanhaja dynasty. He had earlier (935) built his own house and a Sanhaja center at Ashir, just south of Algiers. Although his Zirid dynasty was overthrown by Roger II of Sicily in 1148, the Zirids had already lost control of Algiers to their cousins the Hammadids in 1014. The city was wrested from the Hammadids by the Almohads in 1159, and in the 13th century came under the dominion of the Ziyanid sultans of Tlemcen. Nominally part of the sultanate of Tlemcen, Algiers had a large measure of independence under amirs of its own due to Oran being the chief seaport of the Ziyanids. As early as 1302 the islet of Pe\u00f1\u00f3n in front of Algiers harbour had been occupied by Spaniards. Thereafter, a considerable amount of trade began to flow between Algiers and Spain. However, Algiers continued to be of comparatively little importance until after the expulsion of the Moors from Spain, many of whom sought asylum in the city. In 1510, following their occupation of Oran and other towns on the coast of Africa, the Spaniards fortified the islet of Pe\u00f1on and imposed a levy intended to suppress corsair activity. In 1516, the amir of Algiers, Selim b. Teumi, invited the corsair brothers Aruj and Hayreddin Barbarossa to expel the Spaniards. Aruj came to Algiers, ordered the assassination of Selim, and seized the town and ousted the Spanish in the Capture of Algiers (1516). Hayreddin, succeeding Aruj after the latter was killed in battle against the Spaniards in the Fall of Tlemcen (1517), was the founder of the pashaluk, which subsequently became the beylik, of Algeria."}

However, just before they were about to be discovered by the resident White army troops, they launched an attack against them on the night of December 16, 1916. Their intentions were to free the local indigenous people from their debts to the Russian incomers and begin the dismantling of the capitalist infrastructure that had been established in the town. The attempts at seizing the property of the merchant class in Anadyr was successful, but they were unable to seize control of the armory and ammunition supplies within the town. The merchants used this opportunity to reassert themselves, and by January 30, 1920, they surrounded the Revkom offices and attacked. One of the leaders, Vasily Titov, was killed and a number of others were wounded. Mikhail Mandrikov himself surrendered. Although the survivors were initially imprisoned, the merchants decided to eliminate them permanently."}

After the French lost the French and Indian War (Seven Years' War), they ceded Natchez and near territory to Spain in the Treaty of Paris of 1763. (It later traded other territory east of the Mississippi River with Great Britain, which expanded what it called West Florida). After the United States acquired this area from the British after the American Revolutionary War, the city served as the capital of the American Mississippi Territory and then of the state of Mississippi. It predates Jackson by more than a century; the latter replaced Natchez as the capital in 1822, as it was more centrally located in the developing state. The strategic location of Natchez, on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River, ensured that it would be a pivotal center of trade, commerce, and the interchange of ethnic Native American, European, and African cultures in the region; it held this position for two centuries after its founding. In U. S. history, Natchez is recognized particularly for its role in the development of the Old Southwest during the first half of the nineteenth century. It was the southern terminus of the historic Natchez Trace, with the northern terminus being Nashville, Tennessee. After unloading their cargoes in Natchez or New Orleans, many pilots and crew of flatboats and keelboats traveled by the Trace overland to their homes in the Ohio River Valley. (Given the strong current of the Mississippi River, it was not until steam-powered vessels were developed in the 1820s that travel northward on the river could be accomplished by large boats. ) The Natchez Trace also played an important role during the War of 1812. Today the modern Natchez Trace Parkway, which commemorates this route, still has its southern terminus in Natchez. In the middle of the nineteenth century, the city attracted wealthy Southern planters as residents, who built mansions to fit their ambitions. Their plantations were vast tracts of land in the surrounding lowlands along the river fronts of Mississippi and Louisiana, where they grew large commodity crops of cotton and sugarcane using slave labor. Natchez became the principal port from which these crops were exported, both upriver to Northern cities and downriver to New Orleans, where much of the cargo was exported to Europe. Many of the mansions built by planters before 1860 survive and form a major part of the city's architecture and identity. Agriculture remained the primary economic base for the region until well into the twentieth century. During the twentieth century, the city's economy experienced a downturn, first due to the replacement of steamboat traffic on the Mississippi River by railroads in the early 1900s, some of which bypassed the river cities and drew away their commerce."}

This allowed them to have a separate church and minister, but were still under jurisdiction of the Town of Cambridge. Lexington was incorporated as a separate town in 1713. It was then that it got the name Lexington. How it received its name is the subject of some controversy. Some people believe that it was named in honor of Lord Lexington, an English peer. Some, on the other hand, believe that it was named after Lexington (which was pronounced and is today spelled Laxton) in Nottinghamshire, England. In the early colonial days, Vine Brook, which runs through Lexington, Burlington, and Bedford, and then empties into the Shawsheen River, was a focal point of the farming and industry of the town. It provided for many types of mills, and in the 20th Century, for farm irrigation. For decades, Lexington grew modestly while remaining largely a farming community, providing Boston with much of its produce. It always had a bustling downtown area, which remains to this day. Lexington began to prosper, helped by its proximity to Boston, and having a rail line (originally the Lexington and West Cambridge Railroad, later the Boston and Maine Railroad) service its citizens and businesses, beginning in 1846 (turned into a bikeway in 1992). For many years, East Lexington was considered a separate village from the rest of the town, though it still had the same officers and Town Hall. Most of the farms of Lexington became housing developments by the end of the 1960s. Lexington, as well as many of the towns along the Route 128 corridor, experienced a jump in population in the 1960s and 70s, due to the high-tech boom. Property values in the town soared, and the school system became nationally recognized for its excellence. The town participates in the METCO program, which buses minority students from Boston to suburban towns to receive better educational opportunities than those available to them in the Boston Public Schools. On April 19, 1775, what many regard as the first battle of the American Revolutionary War was a battle at Lexington. After the rout, the British march on toward Concord where the militia had been allowed time to organize at the Old North Bridge and turn back the British and prevent them from capturing and destroying the militia's arms stores."}

This Decree, which was only ecclesiastical in character, was, however, to have unfortunate consequences in subsequent border disputes with Peru. On 23 June 1824 the Senate and House of Representatives of the Republic of Colombia issued a Law on Territorial Division which organized the territory of the Gran Colombia in twelve departments. Each department comprised provinces and cantons. The area belonged to the canton Pastaza Macas of the Province of Chimborazo in Ecuador called Department No. 10. During these years the Ecuadorian \"East\" (Oriente) was abandoned by the central powers; the presence of missionaries decreased even stopped several times, traders transited rather sporadically, exploiters of gold and Spices of the region, especially furs, latex and cinnamon. On May 29th, 1861, and in the independent Ecuador, the National Convention issued the First Law on Territorial Division that distributed the country in fifteen provinces, one of them, \"East\". From then the Amazon territories were identified by that name. However, many Amazonian jurisdictions were still attached to the provinces of the Sierra. The cantons of Coast and Sierra were made up of parishes; those in the East were built also by peoples and territories. Oriente Province consisted of the Napo and Canelos cantons. The Canelos canton included the towns of Canelos, Sarayaku, Lliquino, Andoas and Sapara and Jivaro tribes who formed the missions of Canelos. During the first government of Gabriel Garc\u00eda Moreno in 1869, the Vicariate of the Eastern Missions was created and entrusted to the Jesuits. In 1886, during the government of Caama\u00f1o, the Vicariate was divided into four apostolic prefectures, Canelos and Macas being entrusted to the Dominicans. We must consider that the Government of Ecuador invested missionaries with full political and civil authority at that time, an example being Rvdo.

The Kumeyaay referred to the area now known as Rosarito Beach as Wa-cuatay, which translates to \"big houses\" in the Kumeyaay language. After conquering the Aztec Empire, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s sent expeditions to explore what he believed to be the Island of California. In 1533, mutineer Fort\u00fan Xim\u00e9nez was the first European to land in Baja California, at La Paz, Baja California Sur. In September 1542, Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo passed through the Rosarito Beach area on his way from Ensenada to San Diego Bay. 1697 saw the establishment of the first permanent European settlement in Baja California in a Jesuit mission at Loreto. Rosarito would soon be caught in a power struggle between Jesuits, Dominicans, and Franciscan monks for decades. In 1773, a frontier was defined separating Nueva (\"new\") or Alta (\"upper\") California, under the jurisdiction of the Franciscans, from Antigua (\"old\") or Baja (\"lower\") California, which was entrusted to the Dominicans. In 1788, Luis de Sales, a Dominican priest, redrew the boundary, extending Baja California to the Rosarito Arroyo, known at the time as the Barrabas Arroyo. Because Mission San Miguel, 13 kilometers to the south, was frequently flooded by the R\u00edo Guadalupe, Dominican missionary Tom\u00e1s de Ahumada sought another site on higher ground for at El Descanso. Additional advantages of the northerly location were good grazing and plentiful arable land. In 1817, Ahumada founded the Misi\u00f3n El Descanso or Misi\u00f3n San Miguel la Nueva among the Kumeyaay people 22 kilometers to the south of the present-day Rosarito Beach. In 1830, Father F\u00e9lix Caballero constructed an adobe church here and managed both missions from El Descanso, but in 1834, it ceased to function as a mission. At the time it had a population of just 254, including those from Mission San Miguel. By 1853 the mission was deserted. Ruins of Misi\u00f3n El Descanso remain within the community of El Descanso. The property of Rancho El Rosario, granted by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Echeand\u00eda in 1827 to Don Jos\u00e9 Manuel Machado, one of the first soldiers stationed at the Presidio of San Diego, was the first ranch in the modern-day Rosarito region. The 11 league rancho was bounded on the north by Rancho T\u00eda Juana, on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the south by public lands. Subsequently, his son, Don Joaqu\u00edn Machado, applied for title to the land as Rancho Rosarito to President Porfirio D\u00edaz. On May 14, 1885, Machado received his title and registered it in Ensenada, then the capital city of the Northern District of Baja California Territory."}

To the east of the plain and near the estuary of the river is a strategic and well-protected location for a port. This led to the rise of C\u1ea3ng Th\u1ecb N\u1ea1i, one of the major ports of Champa. The river leading up into the highlands to the west was important for the trade with highland peoples supplying Champa with luxury goods such as eaglewood for export. Vijaya's geography was also important for its agriculture. With one of the larger rivers of Champa, its soils were more fertile than that of many other places. This allowed for a relatively large concentration of people near the centre of Vijaya, which resulted in a relatively large number of temples. The area around Vijaya was probably one of earliest landfalls of the Cham people in what is now Vietnam. However, its architecture implies that it did not become important until the 11th or 12th century. Records suggest that there was an attack on Vijaya's citadel from Vietnam in 1069 (when Vietnam was ruled by L\u00fd Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng) to punish Champa for armed raiding in Vietnam. The Cham king Rudravarman III was defeated and captured and offered Champa's three northern provinces to Vietnam (present-day Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh and Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb provinces). Vijaya was also involved in wars with Angkor (now Cambodia) in the 12th and 13th centuries. Khmer military incursions into Champa were successful for some time and Suryavarman II managed to subdue Vijaya in the 1145, deposing Jaya Indravarman III, but the Khmer were later defeated in 1149. Vijaya was at times dominated by the Khmer king Jayavarman VII. The Khmer king relied on Cham supporters for his successful military campaigns in both Angkor and Champa. Major wars with Vietnam were fought again in the 15th century, which eventually led to the defeat of Vijaya and the demise of Champa in 1471. The citadel of Vijaya was besieged for one month in 1403 when the Vietnamese troops had to withdraw because of a shortage of food. The final attack came in early 1471 after almost 70 years without major military confrontation between Champa and Vietnam. It is interpreted to have been a reaction to Champa asking China for reinforcements to attack Vietnam. Although much of Champa was dissolved after 1471, Vijaya, as well as other principalities, remained as a sort of protectorate within Vietnam."}

The first archbishop of the town was Asztrik, who brought the crown to Stephen from the Pope. In the first decade of the 11th century, the first church was built. In the Middle Ages history of Hungary, some generals served as archbishops. For example, Ugrin Cs\u00e1k (archbishop from 1219 till 1241) was the leader against the Tartars at the battle of Mohi 11 April 1241. Another significant general was P\u00e1l Tomori who was (archbishop from 1523 till 1526) the leader of the Hungarian army against the Ottomans. He was killed in an action at the battle of Moh\u00e1cs. The Turks entered Kalocsa on August 15, 1529. With people of the town dispersed, nobody cultivated the lands, and the archiepiscopal status lost its importance. In 1602, Hungarian Calvinistic Haiduk burned down Kalocsa. After the 148 years lasting rule, on 13 October 1686 the Turks burnt down the castle of Kalocsa and withdrew their troops. Peace was delayed because of the uprising against the Habsburgs led by the Transylvanian Prince Ferenc R\u00e1k\u00f3czi II. The returned archbishops tried to increase the population and attracted new residents. Cardinal Imre Cs\u00e1ki (1710\u20131732) recovered the lands for Kalocsa and its neighbours.

Around 600 families would settle in what became known as Peters Colony from 1841 through 1844. The Peters' group advertised heavily in Kentucky, Illinois, Missouri, and Tennessee, and for that reason, many of the earliest settlers were from those states. The first group to settle in the Lancaster area was Roderick Rawlins and his family from Greene County, Illinois. They left for Texas in September 1844. Rawlins and two of his sons-in-law came ahead to select the general area where they would settle. They chose an uninhabited area south of Dallas along the north bank of Ten Mile Creek as the site of their new settlement. In December 1844, the three men went back to Lamar County near the Red River to bring the rest of their wagon train. All of the settlers had arrived by January 2, 1845 and they formed a community known as Hardscrabble. It consisted of two rows of log cabins with a street running north and south.

The completion of the railroad soon brought a flood of new residents and business enterprises. White Cloud, a town of perhaps 200 persons and a variety of businesses, was located about where the present Wabash Trace Nature Trail crosses the Nishnabotna River three miles southeast of Malvern. It soon closed down when the new railroad was built two miles north. Several business enterprises and White Cloud residents moved to Malvern. Malvern grew almost explosively in its first two years. In its fifth year, Mr. Paddock reported in his Brief History of Malvern, it had a population of 800. It served a particularly productive farming area. It soon had a number of factories, including a hog packing plant, an electric generation plant (in 1892) which permitted a municipal water system, and in the early part of the twentieth century, developed a varied poultry industry that at one time furnished employment for up to 200 persons. Malvern started a school system in 1870, a county fair in 1873, a Chautauqua in 1905, built the town library in 1916 and the present Liberty Memorial Community Building in 1926 When the \u201cgood roads\u201d movement came to Iowa, the town was omitted from Highway 34, causing some economic stress.

The first settlers in the Maldivian islands were Dravidian people who arrived from the neighboring shores of the modern Indian Subcontinent and coastal Ceylon.

The people of Giraavaru, an island located in Mal\u00e9 Atoll (now a tourist resort, after the forced diaspora of its inhabitants) claim to descend from the first settlers of the Maldives, none other than the ancient Tamils. It is said that Giraavaru fishermen used to go regularly to a certain large sandbank (finolhu) at the southern end of their atoll to clean tuna fish after a good catch. Owing to the large amount of tuna fish offal and blood, the waters around that sandbank looked like a big pool of blood (maa ley gandeh). \"Maa\" (from the Sanskrit \u092e\u0939 \"Maha\"), meaning big, and \"L\u0113\" meaning blood. Traditionally the first inhabitants of the Maldives, which include the Giravaru people, didn't have kings. They lived in a simple society and were ruled by local headmen. However, one day, a prince from the Subcontinent called Koimala arrived in the Mal\u00e9 Atoll sailing from the North on a big ship. The people of Giraavaru spotted his vessel from afar and welcomed him. They allowed Prince Koimala to settle on that large sandbank in the midst of the waters tainted with fish blood."}

The oldest traces date back to the Bronze age. Between 1000 and 800 B. C. people of the Lusatian culture fortified the so-called \"city hill\" and incorporated this fortification into their Silesian defence system. This fort was probably destroyed during a battle against the Scythian around 500 BC. Members of the Germanic Silingi tribe who did not participate in the Migration Period but stayed in Silesia chose the place in the 4th century as their fortified center of a Germanic settlement area between \"mons Silencii\" (\u015al\u0119\u017ca) and the river \"Selenca\" (\u015al\u0119za). Slavs arrived after the 6th century and called this place \"Nemci\" ( = mute, metaphorically \"those who do not speak our language\"). Thietmar of Merseburg later described \"Nemzi\" as \"eo quod a nostris olim sitcondita, dicta\" (Nemzi is called like that because it is, according to reports, founded by our people). The settlement was expanded and evolved into the center of the \u015al\u0119\u017canie district. In early times Niemcza became an important base in Bohemias fight for Silesia. After 990 it was seized by Poland and withstood both emperor Henry II. in 1017 and a major offensive of Bohemia in 1093. After 1155 it became the center of a Piast castellany district. This preurban civitas consisted of a settlement enclosed by imposing ramparts in great-moravian design (the only one in Silesia), the castellany castle with St. Peter chapel, first mentioned in 1288/95, and a market place around St. Adalbert church, one of the oldest churches of Silesia, outside and to the west of the ramparts. The area was surrounded by several manors. The German Ostsiedlung reached Niemcza and the surrounding area already in 1210. The settlement however grew only slow as the new German town was founded directly on the soil of the cramped old Polish urbs, whereas the more spacious market place around St."}

There has been further speculation that this use of \"Westwego\" as a place name may have been influenced by the board members' familiarity with the name of Oswego, New York. The area of Westwego, Louisiana was inhabited by Native Americans for thousands of years before Europeans settled here. These indigenous people created huge shells middens that can still be seen in the vicinity today.

When night fell and the Chechens came out of their hiding places to drag the gun away all the other guns opened up with grapeshot. When the Chechens recovered their senses and began to carry away the bodies the guns fired again. When it was over 200 dead were counted. Thus did the 'terrible' fort receive its baptism of fire. It was a prominent defense center during the Caucasian War. After the annexation of the region by the Russian Empire, the military use of the old fortress was obsolete and in December 1869 it was renamed Grozny and granted town status.

The following year, Teutonic Knights began the construction of an Ordensburg castle as a stronghold against the Old Prussians. The German name \"Allenstein\" refers to a stronghold on the Alle River \u2013 which became known in Polish transliteration as Olsztyn. Allenstein received municipal rights in October 1353, and the castle was completed in 1397. The town was captured by the Kingdom of Poland during the Polish-Lithuanian-Teutonic War in 1410, and again in 1414 during the Hunger War, but it was returned to the monastic state of the Teutonic Knights after hostilities ended. Allenstein joined the Prussian Confederation in 1440 and rebelled against the Teutonic Knights in 1454 upon the outbreak of the Thirteen Years' War. Although the Teutonic Knights recaptured the town the following year, it was retaken by Polish troops in 1463. The Second Peace of Thorn in 1466 designated Allenstein and the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia as part of Royal Prussia under the sovereignty of the Polish Crown. From 1516 to 1521, Nicolaus Copernicus lived at the castle as administrator of both Allenstein and Mehlsack (now Pieni\u0119\u017cno). Copernicus was in charge of the Siege of Allenstein and Warmia during the Polish-Teutonic War of 1519\u201321. Allenstein was sacked by Swedish troops in both 1655 and 1708 during the Polish-Swedish wars, and the town's population was nearly wiped out in 1710 by epidemics of bubonic plague and cholera. The town became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1772 after the First Partition of Poland. A Prussian census recorded a population of 1,770 people, predominantly farmers, and Allenstein was administered within the Province of East Prussia. It was visited by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1807 after his victories over the Prussian Army at Jena and Auerstedt. By 1825, the town was inhabited by 1341 Germans and 1266 Poles. The first German-language newspaper, the Allensteiner Zeitung, began publishing in 1841. The town hospital was founded in 1867. In 1871, with the unification of Germany under Prussian hegemony, Allenstein became part of the German Empire. Two years later, the city was connected by railway to Toru\u0144. Its first Polish language newspaper, the Gazeta Olszty\u0144ska, was founded in 1886."}

This name was rejected by the Post Office, forcing a change of name. Joseph Andrews, a major and veteran of the American Civil War, suggested the name \"What Cheer,\" and the town was officially renamed on December 1, 1879. Sources differ as to why the name What Cheer was chosen. The phrase what cheer with you is an ancient English greeting dating back at least to the 15th century. One theory of the name is that a Scottish miner exclaimed What cheer! on discovering a coal seam near town. A more elaborate theory suggests that Joseph Andrews chose the name because of one of the founding myths of his native town of Providence, Rhode Island. According to the story, when Roger Williams arrived at the site that would become Providence in 1636, he was greeted by Narragansett Native Americans with \"What Cheer, Netop\". Netop was the Narragansett word for friend, and the Narragansetts had picked up the what cheer greeting from English settlers. It is possible that the connection between What Cheer, Iowa and What Cheer, the shibboleth of Rhode Island, was merely coincidental - the entries for these subjects are adjacent but not connected in the 1908 edition of the Encyclopedia Americana. It has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names. Robert Forsyth, born in Kilmarnock, Scotland, came to America in 1857, and made his way to Rock Island, Illinois, where he arrived penniless. He worked for most of a decade as a coal miner before coming to Petersburg, the future What Cheer. In the 1870s, he began buying coal lands around town, mostly on credit. When the railroad came to town, he leased his land to the coal companies and bought into a local drug store, eventually operating stores in What Cheer, Mystic and Jerome, Iowa. Other Scots from the Kilmarnock region (Ayrshire) also settled in the area. Robert Orr came in 1875 after working in the coal mines of Colchester, Illinois. His son Alexander went on a successful career as a mine owner in Mystic. The Burlington, Cedar Rapids and Northern Railway (BCR&N) built a branch to What Cheer in 1879. With the arrival of the railroad, the What Cheer coalfield quickly became one of the most important coal mining centers in Iowa."}

Rovigno was eventually incorporated into the Byzantine Empire, later becoming part of the Exarchate of Ravenna in the 6th century, before being taken over by the Frankish Empire in 788. For the following several centuries it was ruled by a succession of feudal lords, and in 1209 it was acquired by the Patriarchate of Aquileia under Wolfger von Erla. From 1283 to 1797 Rovigno was one of the most important towns in Istria governed by the Republic of Venice. During this period three town gates were constructed and Rovinj was fortified by two rows of defensive walls, remains of which can still be seen today. Nearby the Rovinj/Rovigno pier one can find one of the old town gates, the Balbi's Arch, dating from 1680, and a late-Renaissance clock tower. The first city statute was proclaimed in 1531. Following the fall of Venice in 1797 and the ensuing Napoleonic interlude, Rovigno became part of the Austrian Empire, which lasted until World War I. According to the last Austrian census in 1911, 97. 8% of the population was Italian-speaking. It then belonged to Kingdom of Italy from 1918 to 1947, when it was ceded to SFR Yugoslavia, as part of SR Croatia. The original town name Rovigno was then changed into Rovinj. During the post-war period many Italian inhabitants left Rovinj/Rovigno, which led to significant changes to Rovinj/Rovigno's demographic structure.

However, for reasons unknown, municipal authorities chose to celebrate the city's 1100th anniversary in 1999. The settlement is indeed an old one, as archeologists unearthed a Paleolithic dwelling as well as Scythian remains within the city limits. The present name of the city is traditionally connected to the settlement Ltava which is mentioned in the Hypatian Chronicle in 1174. According to the chronicle, on Saint Peter's Day (12 July) of 1182, Igor Sviatoslavich, chasing hordes of the Cuman khans Konchak and Kobiak, crossed the Vorskla River near Ltava and moved towards Pereyaslav (presumably the modern Pereiaslav-Khmelnytskyi), where Igor's army was victorious over the Cumans. During the Mongol invasion of Rus' in 1238\u201339 many cities of the middle Dnieper region were destroyed, possibly including Ltava. In the mid 14th century the region was part of the Duchy of Kiev, which was a vassal of the Algirdas' Grand Duchy of Lithuania. According to the Russian historian Aleksandr Shennikov, the region around modern Poltava was a Cuman Duchy belonging to Mansur, who was a son of Mamai. Shennikov also claims that the Mansur Duchy joined the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as an associated state rather than a vassal state, and that the city of Poltava already existed at that time. In 1399 the army of Mansur assisted the army of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the battle of the Vorskla River, while a legend says that after the battle, the Cossack Mamay helped Vytautas to escape his death. The city is mentioned for the first time under the name of Poltava no later than 1430. Supposedly, in 1430 the Lithuanian duke Vytautas gave the city, along with Glinsk (today a village near the city of Romny) and Glinitsa, to Murza Olexa (Loxada Mansurxanovich), who moved to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from the Golden Horde. In 1430 Murza Olexa was baptized as Alexander Glinsky, who was a progenitor of the Glinsky family. According to Shenninkov, Alexander Glinsky must have been baptized in 1390 by Cyprian, Metropolitan of Kiev, who had just regained his title of Metropolitan of Kiev and all Russia (rather than the Metropolitan of Russia Minor and Lithuania) and on 6 March 1390 permanently moved to Muscovy. In 1482 Poltava was razed by the Crimean Khan Mengli I Giray. In 1537 Ografena Vasylivna Glinska (Baibuza) passed Poltava to her son-in-law Mykhailo Ivanovych Hrybunov-Baibuza. After the Union of Lublin in 1569, the territory around Poltava became part of the Crown of Poland. In 1630 Poltava was passed to a Polish magnate, Bartholomew Obalkowski. In 1641 it changed ownership again, to Alexander Koniecpolski. In 1646 Poltava became part of Wi\u015bniowiecki Ordynatsia (a large Wi\u015bniowiecki estate in Left-bank Ukraine centered in Lubny), governed by the Ruthenian-Polish magnate Jeremi Wi\u015bniowiecki (1612\u201351)."}

The last of them, Pribislav, died in 1150. From 1153/1154 to 1157 Brendanburg was part of the Slavonic Duchy of Kopanica, a fief of Poland. Afterwards Albert I settled here and became the first margrave of Brandenburg. The town was restricted to the western bank of the Havel until 1196, when it was extended to the eastern side. The parts on either side of the river were regarded as three towns (Old Town, New Town and Brandenburg cathedral district) for centuries. In 1314\u20131315 the Old and New Towns joined the Hanseatic League. In the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648) the towns suffered plundering and destruction which led to a loss of power; Potsdam became the new capital, and the court left the town of Brandenburg. In 1715 Old Town and New Town were merged to form a single town. In 1928 the Brandenburg cathedral district was added. In the late 19th century Brandenburg an der Havel became a very important industrial center in the German Empire. Steel industries settled there, and several world-famous bicycle brands such as Brennabor, Corona and Excelsior were manufactured in the city. A world-famous toy industry was also established. With a giant industrial complex, the Deutsche Reichsbahn (German Imperial Railways) was located in Brandenburg-Kirchm\u00f6ser during the time between the two world wars and the time of the former GDR. The city's excellent transport infrastructure was a big advantage. In 1933/34, a concentration camp, one of the first in Nazi Germany, was located on Neuendorfer Stra\u00dfe in Brandenburg Old Town."}

The town was established in 1878 and incorporated in 1882, and was named after John Hyden, a state senator of the time who helped form Leslie County. The mountainous terrain made the region difficult to access except by river, which was no longer the dominant form of transportation by the late 19th century, hindering growth. Frontier Nursing University opened in Hyden in 1939. Hyden briefly came to national attention when the Hurricane Creek mine disaster occurred in late 1970, five miles away. In July 1978, Richard Nixon came to Hyden to make his first public speech since resigning from the presidency during the Watergate crisis. Hyden was picked because U. S. Rep. Tim Lee Carter invited him to attend the dedication of a recreation facility and Nixon wanted a town that had heavily supported his presidential runs. Leslie County Judge-Executive C. Allen Muncy claimed the Nixon invitation prompted the U. S.

In 1778, although the Victoria area of the Strait of Juan de Fuca was not penetrated until 1790, Spanish sailors visited Esquimalt Harbour (just west of Victoria proper) in 1790, 1791, and 1792. In 1841 James Douglas was charged with the duty of setting up a trading post on the southern tip of Vancouver Island, upon the recommendation by George Simpson a new more northerly post be built in case Fort Vancouver fell into American hands (see Oregon boundary dispute). Douglas founded Fort Victoria, on the site of present-day Victoria, British Columbia in anticipation of the outcome of the Oregon Treaty in 1846, extending the British North America/United States border along the 49th parallel from the Rockies to the Strait of Georgia. Erected in 1843 as a Hudson's Bay Company trading post on a site originally called Camosun (the native word was \"camosack\", meaning \"rush of water\") known briefly as \"Fort Albert\", the settlement was renamed Fort Victoria in November 1843, in honour of Queen Victoria. The Songhees established a village across the harbour from the fort. The Songhees' village was later moved north of Esquimalt. When the crown colony was established in 1849, a town was laid out on the site and made the capital of the colony. The superintendent of the fort, Chief Factor James Douglas was made the second governor of the Vancouver Island Colony (Richard Blanshard was first governor, Arthur Edward Kennedy was third and last governor), and would be the leading figure in the early development of the city until his retirement in 1864. When news of the discovery of gold on the British Columbia mainland reached San Francisco in 1858, Victoria became the port, supply base, and outfitting centre for miners on their way to the Fraser Canyon gold fields, mushrooming from a population of 300 to over 5000 within a few days. Victoria was incorporated as a city in 1862. In 1865, Esquimalt was made the North Pacific home of the Royal Navy, and remains Canada's Pacific coast naval base. In 1866 when the island was politically united with the mainland, Victoria was designated the capital of the new united colony instead of New Westminster \u2013 an unpopular move on the Mainland \u2013 and became the provincial capital when British Columbia joined the Canadian Confederation in 1871. In the latter half of the 19th century, the Port of Victoria became one of North America's largest importers of opium, serving the opium trade from Hong Kong and distribution into North America. Opium trade was legal and unregulated until 1865, then the legislature issued licences and levied duties on its import and sale. The opium trade was banned in 1908. In 1886, with the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway terminus on Burrard Inlet, Victoria's position as the commercial centre of British Columbia was irrevocably lost to the city of Vancouver, British Columbia. The city subsequently began cultivating an image of genteel civility within its natural setting, aided by the impressions of visitors such as Rudyard Kipling, the opening of the popular Butchart Gardens in 1904 and the construction of the Empress Hotel by the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1908. Robert Dunsmuir, a leading industrialist whose interests included coal mines and a railway on Vancouver Island, constructed Craigdarroch Castle in the Rockland area, near the official residence of the province's lieutenant-governor."}

George Vason wrote of their arrival that: The second oldest book dedicated to Tonga was by William Mariner, adopted son of Finau 'Ulukalala, which was published in 1817. Mariner described his experiences during the years he was the adopted son of 'Ulukalala (1806\u20131810). He described the civil war and the siege of the Fort of Nuku'alofa, which fell to 'Ulukalala and his warriors. The third attempt of Christian missionaries were recorded in April 1826, when two Tahitian London Missionaries were detained by Tupou the chief of Nuku'alofa. The arrival of the Methodist missionaries in Nuku'alofa in 1827 reinforced the Christian faith. The persecution suffered by Christians in Hihifo and Hahake forced a lot of people to seek refuge in Nuku'alofa. Thanks to the encouragement of Tupou, the King of Nuku'alofa, this was the beginning of the expanding of Nuku'alofa to become the major center of Christianity in Tonga. The US Exploring Expedition met with King Josiah (Aleamotu'a) in 1840. The final phase of the arrival of Christianity in Tonga was the arrival of Father Chevron, or Patele Sevelo, in 1842.

On 20 December 20, 1974, avalanches came from the entire mountainside above the town, killing 12 people. Intense snowfall had been reported in the area over the previous few days. Along with the snow came a strong wind that apparently loosened the snow that had fallen on the mountains. According to some accounts, the first small-scale avalanche actually occurred on 19 December; however, due to low visibility, no-one noticed it. Since the time of the deadly avalanches, a number of protective barriers have been installed with the aim of avoiding future avalanches. Prior to the 1974 avalanche, in 1885 and 1894, two other avalanches had been recorded, with the former causing several deaths in two farms.

The region received influx of German burghers in the second half of the 13th century during the medieval Ostsiedlung. The settlement became a city with Crossener Recht, a variation of Magdeburg rights, in 1323.

The Viking name Dj\u00fara-b\u00fd, recorded in Old English as Deoraby, means \"Village of the Deer\". This popular belief is asserted by Tim Lambert who states, \"The name Derby is derived from the Danish words deor by meaning deer settlement. \" However the origin of the name \"Derby\" would seem to be elusive: some say it is a corruption of the original Roman name 'Derventio': pronunciation of the letter 'v' as 'b', hence Derbentio, hence Derby, whilst others claim the name could be linked with the river Derwent which flows through the city, in that Derby could be a shortened version of Derwent by, meaning \"Derwent settlement\". Another possible origin comes from Celtic because \"Derwent\" means \"a valley thick with oaks\". The town name appears, nevertheless, as 'Darby' or 'Darbye' in early maps, such as that of Speed (1610). Modern research (2004) into the history and archaeology of Derby has provided evidence that the Vikings and Anglo-Saxons probably co-existed, occupying two areas of land surrounded by water. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (c. 900) says that \"Derby is divided by water\". These areas of land were known as Nor\u00fewor\u00feig (\"Northworthy\", = \"north enclosure\") and Deoraby, and were at the \"Irongate\" (north) side of Derby. During the Civil War of 1642\u20131646, Derby was garrisoned by Parliamentary troops commanded by Sir John Gell, 1st Baronet, who was appointed Governor of Derby in 1643. These troops took part in the defence of nearby Nottingham, the Siege of Lichfield, the Battle of Hopton Heath and many other engagements in Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire and Cheshire, as well as successfully defending Derbyshire against Royalist armies. A hundred years later, Bonnie Prince Charlie set up camp at Derby on 4 December 1745, whilst on his way south to seize the British crown. The prince called at The George Inn on Irongate, where the Duke of Devonshire had set up his headquarters, and demanded billets for his 9,000 troops. He stayed at Exeter House, Full Street where he held his \"council of war\". A replica of the room is on display at Derby Museum in the city centre. He had received misleading information about an army coming to meet him south of Derby. Although he wished to continue with his quest, he was over-ruled by his fellow officers. He abandoned his invasion at Swarkestone Bridge on the River Trent just a few miles south of Derby."}

The town is young, even by Icelandic standards where urbanization is a fairly recent trend compared to mainland Europe.

The town, which is named after Egilssta\u00f0ir farm, is near the bridge over Lagarflj\u00f3t where all the main roads of the region meet, Route 1 as well as the main routes to the Eastern Region. Egilssta\u00f0ir has grown to become the largest town of East Iceland and its main service, transportation, and administration centre. The town has an airport, college, and a hospital. The town grew quickly during the economic boom in the region from 2004 to 2008 associated with the building of the K\u00e1rahnj\u00fakar Hydropower Plant and Alcoa's aluminium smelting plant in Rey\u00f0arfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur. The growth has slowed markedly since the banking collapse in 2008. In written accounts, Egilssta\u00f0ir is first mentioned in the 15th century as a place for legislative assembly. The nearby river Eyvindar\u00e1 is mentioned in the Saga of the Sons of Droplaug and Saga of the inhabitants of Flj\u00f3tsdalur. Urbanization in Egilssta\u00f0ir can be traced to J\u00f3n Bergsson (1855\u20131923), a farmer, who laid the groundwork for increased commerce and services at the Egilssta\u00f0ir farm by erecting a large residential building there at the start of the 20th century. The house is still in use as a hotel. J\u00f3n bought the farm Egilssta\u00f0r at the close of the 19th century because of its location when he predicted \"Crossroads will be here\", which proved prescient. Along with others, J\u00f3n Bergsson also took the initiative to establish the co-operative Kaupf\u00e9lag H\u00e9ra\u00f0sb\u00faa (KHB) with headquarters there in 1909. In subsequent years, bridges were built over Lagarflj\u00f3t river and Eyvindar\u00e1 river and a road made over Fagridalur to Rey\u00f0arfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur. Later, the regional headquarters for mail and telephone services were located at Egilssta\u00f0ir.

The town soon grew and by 1980 the population exceeded 1000. In 1987, the status of the town was upgraded to kaupsta\u00f0ur and renamed Egilssta\u00f0ab\u00e6r, or the city of Egilssta\u00f0ir.

Lyon on December 17, 1864, as they passed through western Kentucky.

In the 18th century, the area fell under Spanish rule and was ceded by Mexico to the United States in 1850 as a result of the Mexican-American War. Farming, which began in the mid-19th century, was concentrated in the Menifee area. Mining began in the early 1880s with the discovery of a significant quartz lode by miner Luther Menifee Wilson, from which Menifee derived its name. Early development of the Menifee area began with Sun City in the early 1960s, conceptualized as an active retirement community by Del Webb, a building contractor from Phoenix, Arizona. Webb also developed Sun City, Arizona under the same concept. Sun City is a centrally located neighborhood within Menifee with a mix of residential and commercial activity. The Menifee area later grew during the late 1980s and into the early 1990s as a master-planned community. However, lack of resources such as industry-oriented occupations and high-density retail and commercial businesses caused many residents to drive longer distances to nearby cities such as Temecula or Murrieta, to shop, dine, or work. In recent years however, there has been substantial growth in Menifee with new home construction in close proximity to large parks, lakes, and fine amenities, attracting many new residents from all areas of Southern California such as the Inland Empire, San Diego, Orange County and Los Angeles. On June 3, 2008, the residents of the communities encompassing the Menifee area voted to incorporate together to form Riverside County's 26th city. The new City of Menifee was officially established on October 1, 2008. The city of Menifee is bordered on the north, west, south and east by the cities of Perris, Wildomar, Canyon Lake, Lake Elsinore, Murrieta and Winchester. The city center of Menifee lies at the intersection of Newport Road and the Escondido Freeway (Interstate 215).

Henderson County also shares this namesake. Henderson has its roots in a small, block-wide strip of land high above the Ohio River, the site of the present Audubon Mill Park directly south of the city's riverfront boat dock. A village on this site was called \"Red Banks\" by the local Cherokee on account of its reddish clay soil. By the early 1790s, Red Banks had a tavern and several European-American families along with the Cherokee. On November 16, 1792, resident Robert Simpson wrote to Alexander D. Orr in Lexington, requesting help to appoint a magistrate for Red Banks to deal with some of its 30 families he felt were of dubious (criminal) character. During this period, the Red Banks settlement had gained notoriety as a frontier haven for westward-moving outlaws and their families. One such family was that of Squire Samuel Mason. By that time, excluding the Cherokee, the free male inhabitants of Red Bank totaled 62. On March 17, 1775, North Carolina judge Richard Henderson and his Transylvania Company had met with 1,200 Cherokee in a council at Sycamore Shoals (present-day Elizabethton, Tennessee) to purchase over of land between the Ohio, Cumberland, and Kentucky rivers in present-day Kentucky and Tennessee to resell it to white settlers. Known as the Transylvania Purchase, the sale was voided by the Virginia General Assembly, since the territory (and the sole right to purchase land from Indians within its bounds) was part of Virginia's royal charter. However, the commonwealth granted Henderson and his company an area of to develop. It was located at the confluence of the Green and Ohio rivers. Henderson hired Daniel Boone to survey the country and select favorable sites, but Henderson died before the town was developed. Samuel Hopkins and the surveyor Thomas Allin visited Red Banks in 1797 and laid out plans for the future town of Henderson. It was formally established by the Kentucky legislature the same year. A distinguishing characteristic of the new town plan was unusually wide streets, reportedly to prevent a fire in one block from easily spreading to another. Even with diagonal parking spaces outlined on downtown streets today, the streets are wide enough to include two-way traffic and space left over for delivery trucks to park in the center of the streets without interfering. By October 29, 1799, a census for the city of Henderson showed a population of 183."}

However, a 5th-century AD tribe 'Sairindhas Aryans, which inhabited this area, might have also led to its present name. Varahamihira (505 \u2013 587) in his Sanskrit treatise, Brihat Samhita, mentions the city as 'Satudar Desh', later it was inhabited by a tribe of 'Sairindhas Aryans, leading to its present name. According to Huan Tsang, the Chinese traveller who visited India during the seventh century, Sirhind was the capital of the district of Shitotulo, or Shatadru (the present day River Sutlej). In 12th century, Sirhind came under the rule of the Hindu Chauhan Rajputs of Delhi. During the rule of Prithvi Raj Chauhan (1168\u20131192), the Hindu Rajput ruler of Delhi, it became his military outpost. It further rose in glory during the Mughal Empire, when it became its provincial capital, controlling the Lahore-Delhi Highway, the Grand Trunk Road. During the Mughal era, Sirhind was the name for Malwa, since it was the area's capital city. Sirhind was the headquarters of the Mughal administration in Eastern Punjab. Many European travellers describe its splendours, and it also developed into a center of cultural activity. Sirhind was known for the dozens of saints, scholars, poets, historians, calligraphers and scribes who lived there.

Nonetheless, the Spanish form, La Coru\u00f1a, is still widespread, and it is the traditional name in Spanish recommended by the Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola for texts in Spanish. Certain groups of people have advocated elevating the reintegrationist spelling \"Corunha\" to official status, pointing to the provisions of the Spanish Constitution of 1978 and claiming that it is unconstitutional to stipulate use of the Real Academia Galega spelling, but they have not been successful so far. There is no clear evidence as to what word the name derives from. It seems to be from Crunia, of unknown origin and meaning. At the time of Ferdinand II of Le\u00f3n (12th century) the name Crunia was documented for the first time. As usual in Galician-Portuguese (as well as in Castilian Spanish), the cluster ni naturally evolved into the sound , written n, nn or nh in old Galician orthography, nn in Spanish (later abbreviated to \u00f1, as well as the original Latin cluster \"nn\"), and nh in Portuguese and alternative Galician spelling. 'A' is the Galician article equivalent to English the; compare Castilian Spanish la (\"the\"). One proposed etymology derives Crunia from Cluny, the town and religious order from France. During its height (c. 950\u2013c. 1130) the Cluniac movement was one of the largest religious forces in Europe. There is another town named Coru\u00f1a in Burgos Province. Another possibility is that the name means simply \"The Crown\". The Galician word for crown is coroa. It is also possible it came about through changes to the French \"La Couronne\", also meaning \"the Crown\". It seems less likely that it traces back to the Galician \"clunia\"."}

Marcy marked the spring as a campsite on the Overland Trail to California. The site began to collect inhabitants and by the late 1870s, a settlement had sprung up to support buffalo hunters who frequented the area. The original settlement consisted largely of hide huts and saloons. Ranching quickly became a major industry in the area; early ranchers included F. G. Oxsheer, C. C. Slaughter, and B. F. Wolcott. One notable early rancher was Briton Joseph Heneage Finch, the Seventh Earl of Aylesford. Finch purchased of ranch land in the area in 1883, and is credited with building Big Spring's first permanent structure, a butcher's shop. The completion of the Texas and Pacific Railroad led to the founding in the early 1880s of Abilene, Colorado City, and Big Spring, three railroading and ranching cities where saloons and gambling dens flourished. More important in the city's history was the discovery of oil in the region during the 1920s. The early discoveries in the area marked the beginning of the oil industry in the Permian Basin area of West Texas, and the oil industry has continued to be a dominant part of the area's economy.

In 1852, the territorial legislature picked North Cottonwood as the county seat and officially named it Farmington. Following orders from Daniel H. Wells and Brigham Young, Farmington residents built a wall around the city in 1853 under the direction of Major Thomas S. Smith. This walled townsite became known as \"the Fort\". Early church meetings were held in a log school and then an adobe structure. The county courthouse was used for religious meetings from 1855 to 1863. The city's ward moved back to the schoolhouse and the first meetinghouse was dedicated in January 1864. By the early 1860s, the town of Farmington stretched for six miles between Centerville and Kaysville. The Children's Primary Association of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized here on 11 August 1878. It was the birthplace of one of the longest-lived Latter-day Saint apostles, LeGrand Richards.

It was also called Castrum Mahomeria, Magna Mahomeria or Mahomeria Major. It was one of 21 villages given by King Godfrey as a fief to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. In 1114, the gift was re-confirmed by Baldwin I of Jerusalem. In 1156, 92 people from Mahomeria pledged their allegiance to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and a further 50 names were added in the next three decades. Hence, it has been estimated that the total Frankish population at this time was 500-700. The Crusaders built a castle, church and hospice there. The latter two buildings were built by the Knights Templar in 1146 and belonged to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The Ayyubids under Saladin drove away the Crusaders from Birra when they reconquered interior Palestine after the Battle of Hattin in 1187, and completely demolished the town. Yaqut al-Hamawi mentions seeing the ruins a few times during his travels in the area. Nearing the end of Ayyubid rule, in 1280, the modern town of al-Bireh was an inhabited village. The Ayyubids built a mosque in the town dedicated to Umar ibn al-Khattab adjacent to the church ruins. Potsherds from the Crusader/Ayyubid era have been found. Al-Bireh, like the rest of Palestine, was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, and in the census of 1596 the village, called Bira al-Kubra, was a part of the nahiya (\"subdistrict\") of Al-Quds which was under the administration of the liwa (\"district\") of Al-Quds.

Located in the southern end of Salt Lake Valley, the first people of European descent to live in the area that is now Riverton settled in the mid-1850s. These early settlers scattered widely along the river bottom in crude dugout homes. Although the early accounts disagree, Archibald Gardner may have been the first to settle Riverton land. The town was originally referred to as \u201cGardnerville\u201d prior to changing its name to Riverton. Riverton's initial growth was slow because of the lack of water for irrigation. When more water became available, the town began to grow. Eventually three canals were built to extend water from the nearby Jordan River to the benchland areas, providing irrigation for agricultural uses to the larger area.

Abu Dhabi means father of the \"Dhabi\" (gazelle). It is thought that this name came about because of the abundance of Gazelles in the area and a folk tale involving Shakhbut bin Dhiyab al Nahyan. Abu Dhabi is full of archaeological evidence that points to civilisations, such as the Umm an-Nar Culture, having been located there from the third millennium BCE. Settlements were also found farther outside the modern city of Abu Dhabi but closer to the modern city of Al Ain. There is evidence of civilisations around the mountain of Hafeet (Jebel Hafeet). This location is very strategic because it is the UAE\u2019s second tallest mountain, so it would have great visibility. It also contains a lot of moisture in its springs and lakes, which means that there would have been more moisture thousands of years ago. - Origin of the name Abu Dhabi The origin of the name \"Abu Dhabi\" is uncertain. Meaning \"Father of the Gazelle\", when literally translated from Arabic, it probably referred to the few gazelles that inhabit the emirate. According to Bilal al-Budoor, assistant under-secretary for Cultural Affairs at the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Community Development, \"The area had a lot of dhibaa [deer (plural)], and was nicknamed after that. \" An old story tells about a man who used to chase deer [dhabi (deer \u2013 singular)] and was named the \"father\" of the animal. Abu Dhabi's original name was Milh \"salt\", possibly referring to the salty water of the Persian Gulf, or the ancient salt marshes that surround the city. Some Bedouins called the city Umm Dhabi (mother of deer), while British records refer to the place as Abu Dhabi. According to some historical accounts, the name Abu Dhabi was first used more than 300 years ago. The first word of Abu Dhabi is pronounced \"Bu\" by inhabitants on the city's western coast. In the eastern part of the city, the pronunciation is \"Abu\". - Origins of the Al Nahyan family The Bani Yas bedouin were originally centred on the Liwa Oasis. This tribe was the most significant in the area, having over 20 subsections.

According to the Dictionary, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (2. 30%) Greenville is considered to be a part of the humid subtropical region. Due to its location on the north Texas prairies the climate is typically humid with mild precipitation. Greenville was founded in 1846. The city was named after Thomas J. Green, a significant contributor to the establishment of Texas as a Republic. He later became a member of the Congress of the Republic of Texas. The city was almost named \u201cPinckneyville\u201d in honor of James Pinckney Henderson, the first Governor of Texas. As the Civil War loomed, Greenville was divided over the issue of secession, as were several area towns and counties. Greenville attorney and State Senator Martin D. Hart was a prominent Unionist. He formed a company of men who fought for the Union in Arkansas, even as other Greenville residents fought for the Confederacy. The divided nature of Greenville, Hunt County and the State of Texas is noted by an historical marker in \"The SPOT\" Park at 2800 Lee Street in downtown Greenville. In the post-Civil War era, Greenville's economy became partly dependent on cotton as the local economy entered a period of transition.

At the time of European contact, Lenni-Lenape Native Americans lived in the area, following a seasonal pattern of cultivation and hunting and fishing. The state-recognized Nanticoke Lenni-Lenape Indians of New Jersey maintain a cultural center here, serving a community of 12,000 in Cumberland, Gloucester and Salem counties. The first recorded European settlement in what is now Bridgeton was made by 1686 when Richard Hancock established a sawmill here. Settlers established a pioneer iron-works in 1814. Bridgeton was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 3, 1845, from portions of Deerfield Township. Bridgeton city was incorporated on March 1, 1865, replacing both Bridgeton Township and Cohansey Township. The city was named for its location at a bridge on the Cohansey River and is said to be a corruption of \"bridge town\". After the American Civil War, Bridgeton's industrial base and commercial centrality in this area of high agricultural production, along with its high profile as an educational center (it was home to the South Jersey Institute, the West Jersey Academy, and two notable academies for women), made it the most prosperous town in the state. Bridgeton was home to glass factories, sewing factories, metal and machine works and other manufacturers, most notably, the Ferracute Machine Works, which was founded and operated by Oberlin Smith, an inventive genius and philanthropist credited with inventing the first device for magnetic recording, and now in the New Jersey Inventors Hall of Fame. Bridgeton Historic District covers a quarter of the city and includes more than 2,000 properties. These range from the early Federal architecture to the 1920s, including many structures eligible for individual listing and some documented by the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) during the 1930s. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 and is the largest such district of any municipality in New Jersey. Although it is visually dominated by large Victorian homes and a downtown area constructed from the 1880s to the 1920s, the district, besides many neighborhoods of gingerbreaded \"doubles\" that were essentially working-class housing, includes several notable structures dating from the 18th century and early Federal period. One of these is Potter's Tavern, said to have been built in the 1750s, but restored to its appearance in 1776 when it was home to The Plain Dealer, considered New Jersey's first newspaper. A second is Brearley (Masonic) Lodge, founded by General James Giles in 1795, and still active. A third is the so-called \"Nail House\" (c. 1815; second build c. 1855), administrative home of the Cumberland Nail & Iron Works that established Bridgeton's industrial prowess in the early nineteenth century. The first Cumberland National Bank building (1816), which was only the second bank chartered in New Jersey, is now part of the Bridgeton Library."}

The name was changed again to Pleasant Springs before its incorporation on January 17, 1844, when the present name was adopted to honor Rep. John Murray. Murray was not the first county seat, which was at Wadesboro. Calloway County was then much larger than today. In 1842, however, the state legislature divided the area, creating Marshall County. It was felt that a more centrally located county seat was needed, and as the village of Murray was at the geographic center, it was chosen. A new courthouse was built along with a jail, and the town Murray was laid out on an plot subdivided into 137 business and residential lots divided by eight streets. Kentucky did not officially secede from the Union during the Civil War, instead declaring its neutrality, but both Murray and Calloway County were strongly pro-Confederate. No major battles were fought near the town, but guerrilla warfare sometimes took place nearby. In the spring of 1862, a Union force stationed in Paducah marched across the county to the Tennessee River, taking anything it wanted from the inhabitants without paying. Also, parts of Murray were burned on several occasions. Once, part of the town was burned by the Union Army in retaliation for its presumed support for the Confederate guerrillas. A diary kept by Josh Ellison of Murray tells that one night during the winter of 1864-65, a detachment of Union soldiers from Paducah torched every buildings on the east side of the court square, three days later burning all those north of the square. An estimated 800 men from the area joined in the Confederate Army, either as infantry in the Kentucky Orphan Brigade or in the cavalry, while about 200 sided with the Union. Calloway County's Confederate veterans are honored by monument on the northeast side of the court house square.

The third proposed origin of the name is from a misunderstanding of the local Inupiaq word for \"Where at?\", Naami. In February 1899, some local miners and merchants voted to change the name from Nome to Anvil City, because of the confusion with Cape Nome, south, and the Nome River, the mouth of which is south of Nome.

Before Kiana became a village, the Inupiat Eskimos tended to travel with certain animal herds; constantly hunting for meat and furs. In the 1800s, the Inupiaqs of Kiana used to live along the Kobuk River. Throughout the year the villagers would hunt and fish near their houses. They moved to where there was an abundance of animals and fish. The Inupiaqs lived in sod houses, and did not live in them twice, because they would move to where the animals were. When someone died inside the house they abandoned it, believing they would catch a contagious disease. Instead of building coffins or digging graves, the villagers wrapped the bodies of the deceased in cloths and put poles in them to make a teepee shape. Archaeological study has been done on the local site 'Igliqtiqsiugvigruaq' (Swift Water Place) which was inhabited by the ancestors of the present day residents of Kiana from 1790 to 1810. The town consisted of burrowed homes connected by tunnels. The first white men came up with boats in 1898 and changed the way of life. They settled in where is now Kiana. More white men came in 1901 and 1902, and started building houses. Inupiaq women moved to them and married them. Kiana is the central village of the Kobuk river, for Kowagmiut Inupaiq Eskimos. Kiana became known to the Federal Government after a population increase, eventually making the town in to a city, in the year 1915. A United States Post Office was founded in the year 1964. Before the post office was built, mail came only once a month. The mail transportation method was mainly by dogsled or by walking from one village to another.

In March 1912 the French government and the Sultan of Morocco, Abd al-Hafid, signed the Treaty of Fez. Because of his growing unpopularity, the Sultan asked the French government for protection against the Berber rebel tribes surrounding Fez. France appointed Hubert Lyautey resident-general in Morocco. General Lyautey restored peace and order to the country after crushing the tribal uprising. After safely moving the Sultan from Fez to the current capital city, Rabat, Lyautey began his task of civilian administration. One of the first preoccupations of General Lyautey was to build ports along the inhabitable Atlantic coast where there were no natural harbors. He established Kenitra in 1912 as a French military fort and town. The port at Kenitra, at the mouth of the Sebou river, was opened in 1913. It soon became the best river port in Morocco. Kenitra draws its name from a culvert built at Fouarat lake upstream of the kasbah. This culvert was destroyed in 1928. In 1933, the French officially named the locale \"Port Lyautey\". It was renamed \"Quneitra\" in 1956 as Morocco gained its independence. Quneitra has grown rapidly to be a shipping centre for agricultural produce (mainly fruit), fish, timber, and lead and zinc ores. The city\u2019s industrial area lies upstream of the port.

Named after the province of Novorossiya, the port formed a vital link in the chain of forts known as the Black Sea Coastal Line, which stretched south to Sochi. During the rest of the 19th century, Novorossiysk developed rapidly. It was granted city status in 1866 and became the capital of the Black Sea Governorate, the smallest in the Russian Empire, in 1896. In December 1905, the city was the seat of the short-lived Novorossiysk Republic. From August 26, 1918 until March 27, 1920, Novorossiysk was the principal center of Denikin's White Army.

In the 16th century, Emden briefly became an important centre for the Protestant Reformation under the rule of Countess Anna von Oldenburg who was determined to find a religious \"third way\" between Lutheranism and Catholicism. In 1542 she invited the Polish noble John Laski (or Joahannes a Lasco) to become pastor of a Protestant church at Emden; and for 7 years he continued to spread the new religion around the area of East Frisia. However, in 1549 following pressure from the Emperor Charles V, the Countess was forced to ask Laski to leave for England and the experiment came to an end. Nevertheless, the legacy was important for the reformation in the Netherlands. Emden was a very rich city during the 17th century, due to large numbers of Dutch immigrants such as Diederik Jansz. Graeff. It was a centre of reformed Protestantism at that time, producing the first Bible translation in Dutch. The Emden Revolution in 1595 resulted in Emden becoming a distinct city-state. The political theorist Johannes Althusius served as Syndic from 1604 to 1638. In 1744 Emden was annexed by Prussia. In 1752 Frederick the Great chartered the Emden Company to trade with Canton, but the company was ruined when Emden was captured by French forces in 1757 during the Seven Years' War. The city was recaptured by Anglo-German forces in 1758 and for the rest of the conflict was used as a major supply base by the British to support the ongoing war in Westphalia. During the Napoleonic French era, Emden and the surrounding lands of East Frisia were part of the short-lived Kingdom of Holland. Industrialization started at around 1870, with a paper mill and a somewhat bigger shipyard. At the end of the 19th century, a big canal, the Dortmund-Ems Canal was constructed, which connected Emden with the Ruhr area. This made Emden the \"seaport of the Ruhr area\", which lasted until the 1970s. Coal from the south was transported to the North Sea port, and imported iron ore was shipped via the canal towards Rhine and the Ruhr."}

The various resorts became characterized by a high floating population that inhabited the area only in summer or on weekends, while most of the permanent population worked in Montevideo. The abundance of sandy soils made possible the existence of multiple sand pits, which gave rise to the various lakes that characterize the area. Some lakes are used for bathing and water sports, while others are not suitable for these applications and, instead, act as a refuge for many species of birds and animals. Ciudad de la Costa has a humid subtropical climate typical of the region, with warm to hot and wet summers and mild winters with relatively evenly distributed precipitation year-round.

In 1938, the post office was renamed \"Flatwoods\", and the town was incorporated the same year under that name. Flatwoods is named for the area's unique topography, a belt of flat wooded land in the ancient Teays River valley on an elevation of approximately or higher, just south of and higher than the Ohio River valley. The availability of flat level land and low tax rates made Flatwoods a local hot spot of new construction in the 1950s and 1960s, when many upper-middle-class tract housing developments were built and quickly inhabited. A main contributor to Flatwoods' growth was the fact that nearby Ashland had developed much of its available land prior to 1960, with little new construction possible within its corporation limits. Flatwoods is located in eastern Greenup County, between Raceland to the northwest and Russell to the southeast. U. S.

Several traditions agree that the Boeotians were a people expelled from Thessaly some time after the Trojan War, and who colonised the Boeotian plain over a series of generations, of which the occupation of Thespiae formed a later stage. Other traditions suggest that they were of Mycenean origin. In the Archaic Period the Thespian nobility was heavily dependent on Thebes. This possibly reflected that land ownership was concentrated in the hands of a small number of nobles, and therefore there was difficulty in equipping an effective force of hoplites. Thespiae therefore decided to become a close ally of Thebes. The Thespians destroyed Ascra at some point between 700 and 650, and later settled Eutresis between 600 and 550. Thespiae also took control over Creusis, Siphae, Thisbe and Chorisae, probably some time in the late sixth century. The Thessalians invaded Boeotia as far as Thespiae, more than 200 years before Leuctra (according to Plutarch), c. 571 BC, which might have given Thespiae the impetus to join the Boeotian League. But elsewhere Plutarch gives a date for the Thessalian invasion as shortly preceding the Second Persian War. Herodotus suggests that Thespiae had been a member of the league as long as Thebes had been. Following the Persian Wars, Thespiae provided two Boeotarchs to the league, rather than one; perhaps one for the city and one for the districts under its control. During the Persian invasion of 480 BC Thespiae's ability to field a substantial force of hoplites had changed. Thespiae and Thebes were the only Boeotian cities to send a contingent to fight at Thermopylae, Thespiae sending a force of 700 hoplites who remained to fight beside the Spartans on the final day of the battle. In 1997, the Greek government dedicated a monument to the Thespians who fell alongside that of the Spartans. After the battle, Thebes was the final Boeotian state to side with the Persians, and in doing so they denounced both Plataea and Thespiae to Xerxes I as the only Boeotian states to side with the Greeks. After the city was burned down by Xerxes, the remaining inhabitants furnished a force of 1800 men for the confederate Greek army that fought at Plataea. During the Athenian invasion of Boeotia in 424 BC, the Thespian contingent of the Boeotian army sustained heavy losses at the Battle of Delium. In the next year the Thebans dismantled the walls of Thespiae on the charge that the Thespians were pro-Athenian, perhaps as a measure to prevent a democratic revolution."}

A border fortress held by the Polish Piast dynasty was first mentioned in 1104, when it was besieged by the P\u0159emyslid prince Svatopluk of Olomouc. The Ko\u017ale castellany was part of the Polish Duchy of Silesia since 1138, from 1172/73 of the Upper Silesian Duchy of Racib\u00f3rz under the rule of the Silesian Piasts. In 1281, it was inherited by Duke Casimir of Bytom, who also called himself Duke of Ko\u017ale. Casimir soon turned to the neighbouring Kingdom of Bohemia; in 1289, he paid homage to King Wenceslaus II and received his duchy as a Bohemian fief. In 1293, he vested Ko\u017ale with town privileges, had walls erected. After Casimir was succeeded by his son W\u0142adys\u0142aw in 1312, Ko\u017ale remained the capital of an autonomous duchy, ruled by the Bytom branch of the Silesian Piasts until the death of Duke Boles\u0142aw in 1355. King Charles IV adjudicated the reverted Bohemian fief to the Piast duke Konrad I of Ole\u015bnica (Oels), whereafter the town remained a possession of the Ole\u015bnica line until it became extinct in 1492. Again purchased by the Opole duke Jan II the Good in 1509, the Ko\u017ale estates were ultimatively incorporated into the Lands of the Bohemian Crown upon his death in 1532. Within the Habsburg Monarchy, it was temporarily pawned to the Hohenzollern margraves of Brandenburg-Ansbach. The fortress was besieged several times during the Thirty Years' War and occupied by Danish troops under the command of Duke John Ernest I of Saxe-Weimar in 1627, before they were defeated by Imperial forces under Albrecht von Wallenstein. Again conquered by a Swedish contingent led by Lennart Torstensson in 1642, the town remained almost completely devastated. Occupied by the troops of King Frederick the Great in the First Silesian War, Cosel with the bulk of Silesia became a Prussian possession by the 1742 Treaty of Breslau. The king ordered the extension of the fortifications, nevertheless the town was occupied by Habsburg Pandurs during the Second Silesian War in 1744 and had to be reconquered by the Prussian Army two years later; the shelling again caused heavy losses and damages. The rebuilt fortress held against Austrian sieges during the Seven Years' War, even General Ernst Gideon von Laudon in 1760 had to raise his siege. In 1807 the Prussian garrison withstood another besiegement by the allied Napoleonic and Bavarian forces under General Bernhard Erasmus von Deroy until a peace was made by the Treaty of Tilsit. In 1815, Cosel was incorporated into the Prussian Province of Silesia."}

Port Harcourt was founded in 1912 by Frederick Lugard, governor of both the Northern Nigeria Protectorate and the Southern Nigeria Protectorate. Its purpose was to export the coal that geologist Albert Ernest Kitson had discovered in Enugu in 1909. The colonial government caused the people of Diobu to cede their land, and in 1912 the building of a port-town was started. Other villages that were later absorbed into the city included Oroworukwo, Mkpogua, and Rumuomasi; In the creeks to the south of the original port were the fishing camps and grounds of the Okrika-Ijaw group. During the First World War, Port Harcourt was used as a point for military operations against the Central Powers in German Kamerun. After the discovery of crude oil in Oloibiri in 1956, Port Harcourt exported the first shipload from Nigeria in 1958. Port Harcourt became the centre of the Nigerian oil economy and it subsequently reaped benefits of its associations with the petroleum industry by undergoing modernisation and urbanisation. Port Harcourt's growth is further due to its position as the commercial centre and foremost industrial city of the former Eastern Region; its position in the Niger Delta; and its importance as the centre of social and economic life in Rivers State. After the Republic of Biafra seceded from Nigeria in 1967 Port Harcourt fell to Nigerian forces on 19 May 1968. From an area of 15. 54 km in 1914, Port Harcourt grew uncontrolled to an area of 360 km in the 1980s.

The castle in Rydzyna was built at the beginning of 15th century by Jan of Czernina. At the end of the 17th century, Italian architects Joseph Simon Bellotti and Pompeo Ferrari erected the present Baroque castle on its ancient foundations. The first owners of the castle were the Leszczy\u0144ski family. Together with its park and surrounding areas, it was one of the most splendid palaces in Poland. Between 1704 and 1709 it was a residence of the Polish king Stanis\u0142aw I. In 1709, during the Great Northern War, the castle was partly burnt by the tsar's soldiers. However wall-paintings and stucco works in representative rooms, made by the best Italian artists, were not destroyed completely, and the castle was restored and expanded by Prince August Su\u0142kowski, who purchased the Leszczy\u0144ski estates in 1738. The castle, together with its adjacent park and the surrounding terrain, forms one of the most valuable castle-park complexes in Poland. Other historical monuments within the town boundaries are baroque tenement houses around the market square together with the town hall and the baroque parish church, all built in the 18th century and designed by the same architects as the castle. The evangelical church building now serves as a concert hall. In the center of the market square a unique statue representing the Trinity was erected in 1761 by the sculptor Andrew Schmidt in memory of the plague that decimated the town in 1709. The monumental former annexes to the castle, facing its north side, are in Classic style. All the monuments are the works of prominent architects brought in from all over Europe by the Leszczy\u0144ski and Su\u0142kowski families.

In English and other European languages, the town was known historically as Faifo. This word is derived from Vietnamese H\u1ed9i An ph\u1ed1 (the town of H\u1ed9i An), which was shortened to \"Hoi-pho\", and then to \"Faifo\". Between the seventh and 10th centuries, the Cham (people of Champa) controlled the strategic spice trade and with this came tremendous wealth. The former harbour town of the Cham at the estuary of the Thu B\u1ed3n River was an important Vietnamese trading centre in the 16th and 17th centuries, where Chinese from various provinces as well as Portuguese, Japanese, Dutch and Indians settled. During this period of the China trade, the town was called Hai Pho (Seaside Town) in Vietnamese. Originally, Hai Pho was a divided town with the Japanese settlement across the \"Japanese Bridge\" (16th-17th century). The bridge (Ch\u00f9a c\u1ea7u) is a unique covered structure built by the Japanese, the only known covered bridge with a Buddhist temple attached to one side. The early history of H\u1ed9i An is that of the Cham. These Austronesian-speaking Malayo-Polynesian peoples created the Champa Empire which occupied much of what is now central and lower Vietnam, from Hu\u1ebf to beyond Nha Trang. Various linguistic connections between Cham and the related Jarai language and the Austronesian languages of Indonesia (particularly Acehnese), Malaysia, and Hainan has been documented. In the early years, M\u1ef9 S\u01a1n was the spiritual capital, Tr\u00e0 Ki\u1ec7u was the political capital and H\u1ed9i An was the commercial capital of the Champa Empire - later, by the 14th century, the Cham moved further down towards Nha Trang. The river system was used for the transport of goods between the highlands, inland countries of Laos and Thailand and the low lands. In 1535 Portuguese explorer and sea captain Ant\u00f3nio de Faria, coming from Da Nang, tried to establish a major trading centre at the port village of Faifo. H\u1ed9i An was founded as a trading port by the Nguy\u1ec5n Lord Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng sometime around 1595. The Nguy\u1ec5n lords were far more interested in commercial activity than the Tr\u1ecbnh lords who ruled the north. As a result, H\u1ed9i An flourished as a trading port and became the most important trade port on the East Vietnam Sea. Captain William Adams, the English sailor and confidant of Tokugawa Ieyasu, is known to have made one trading mission to H\u1ed9i An in 1617 on a red seal ship (\u6731\u5370\u8239 Shuinsen). The early Portuguese Jesuits also had one of their two residences at H\u1ed9i An. In the 18th century, H\u1ed9i An was considered by Chinese and Japanese merchants to be the best destination for trading in all of south-east Asia, even Asia."}

Oneida's development began to pick up as new trade routes were opened, especially in the period initially following construction of the Oneida Lake canal and feeder and an associated railroad stop, tying it into major trade networks of the day. The Village of Oneida was incorporated on June 20, 1848 as part of the larger Town of Lenox to its west, but years of friction among the different sections of town spurred this village to establish itself independently as the new Town of Oneida in 1896.

Cotabato town was part of Moro Province and of Department of Mindanao and Sulu from 1903 to 1920, when the Empire Province of Cotabato, referred to as \"Moroland\" by the Americans, was founded with the town as the capital, with Datu Piang as its first governor. Several towns were carved off from Cotabato town since the year 1913, with Pikit being the first one founded by Cebuano Christian colonists. Dulawan (now Datu Piang, Maguindanao) and Midsayap were incorporated as regular municipalities in 1936. In 1942, at the beginning of the Pacific Front of World War II, the Japanese Imperial forces entered what is now Maguindanao province.

The name literally means 'to trace a river upstream'. The name of Sorsogon City has been spelled differently in various occasions during its history. When the Spaniards had settled in Gibalong, they set out to further explore the inner lands but got lost upon the discovery of new territories until they reach a small river emptying into what is now Sorsogon Bay. They asked a native they met for the name of the place. The native, not understanding Spanish and thinking they were asking for directions answered \u2018solsogon', which meant trace your way following the river upstream. Through constant use, Sosogon became Sorsogon hence becoming the name of the town. With the coming of the Spanish colonizers in the 1600s, Bacon was organized into a visita of the town of Casiguran, one of the oldest settlements in Luzon. The municipality of Sorsogon, whose original Site was in Sitio Pocdol in Capuy, was in turn, a visita of Bacon. As its population increased, however, Sorsogon was declared an independent, full-fledged parish in 1628. The Pueblo Civil de Bacon was established in 1754, with Juan Elias as its first gobernadorcillo. Sorsogon on the other hand, became an independent political unit in 1864. From their organization as visitas and eventually as independent pueblos, both Bacon and Sorsogon remained under the territorial jurisdiction of the province of Albay. On October 17, 1894, the Spanish authorities organized a geographical unit independent from Albay, with the town of Sorsogon as its seat of government. The new province adopted the name of the town and has since been known as the Province of Sorsogon. Sorsogon City was created by virtue of Republic Act 8806 which was enacted on August 16, 2000, and ratified in December 2000.

In the mid-1860s, George Archer had a sod tavern on the north banks of what was then Lake Manyaska located just south of Sherburn. Marked by a lone Cedar tree, pioneer travelers used it as a rest stop as they traveled from Fairmont to Jackson. Soon there were pioneer settlers and a post office. As stage coaches from Fairmont to Jackson and St. James to Estherville crossed the area, it was concluded that there was a definite need for a settlement. The mid to late 1870s witnessed the arrival of many settlers to Martin County, primarily resulting from the growth of the railroad involving Winnebago City and Fairmont. A company called Cargill, Bassett, and Hunting from La Crosse, Wisconsin, anticipated the railroad expanding west of Fairmont and, consequently, bought land in the area. As steam locomotives took water often, stops were located every fifteen miles or so, which may have contributed the location of the Sherburn railroad station. A post office has been in operation at Sherburn since 1879. Several names were originally considered for the town site, including Lone Cedar, Huntington, and Vestal. But when the Southern Minnesota Railroad came through in October 1878, the name Sherburne was accepted in honor of Sherburne S.

Initially, however, their residence and the centre of the territory was the castle of Plassenburg in Kulmbach. The town of Bayreuth developed slowly and was affected time and again by disasters. As early as 1361 Emperor Charles IV had conferred on Burgrave Frederick V the right to mint coins for the towns of Bayreuth and Kulmbach. Bayreuth was first published on a map in 1421.

Dresden's founding and early growth is associated with the eastward expansion of Germanic peoples, mining in the nearby Ore Mountains, and the establishment of the Margraviate of Meissen. Its name etymologically derives from Old Sorbian Dre\u017e\u010fany, meaning people of the forest. Dresden later evolved into the capital of Saxony. Around the late 12th century, a Slavic settlement called Dre\u017e\u010fany had developed on the southern bank. Another settlement existed on the northern bank, but its Slavic name is unknown. It was known as Antiqua Dresdin by 1350, and later as Altendresden, both literally \"old Dresden\". Dietrich, Margrave of Meissen, chose Dresden as his interim residence in 1206, as documented in a record calling the place \"Civitas Dresdene\". After 1270, Dresden became the capital of the margraviate. It was given to Friedrich Clem after death of Henry the Illustrious in 1288. It was taken by the Margraviate of Brandenburg in 1316 and was restored to the Wettin dynasty after the death of Valdemar the Great in 1319. From 1485, it was the seat of the dukes of Saxony, and from 1547 the electors as well. The Elector and ruler of Saxony Frederick Augustus I became King Augustus II the Strong of Poland in 1697. He gathered many of the best musicians, architects and painters from all over Europe to the newly named Royal-Polish Residential City of Dresden. His reign marked the beginning of Dresden's emergence as a leading European city for technology and art. During the reign of Kings Augustus II the Strong and Augustus III of Poland most of the city's baroque landmarks were built. These include the Zwinger Royal Palace, the Japanese Palace, the Taschenbergpalais, the Pillnitz Castle and the two landmark churches: the Catholic Hofkirche and the Lutheran Frauenkirche. In addition significant art collections and museums were founded. Notable examples include the Dresden Porcelain Collection, the Collection of Prints, Drawings and Photographs, the Gr\u00fcnes Gew\u00f6lbe and the Mathematisch-Physikalischer Salon."}

The first settlement was probably located around today's Hersdorfplatz outside the north-eastern edge of the later city centre. During the 11th century, the nearby Ludowingians received the village and established the city in the late 12th century, as Gotha became their second most important city after Eisenach. The city generated wealth because it was conveniently located at the junction of two important long-distance trade routes: the Via Regia from Mainz and Frankfurt to Leipzig and Breslau and a north-south route from M\u00fchlhausen over the Thuringian Forest to Franconia. One of the oldest pieces of evidence of busy trade in the city is the \"Gotha cache of coins\" with nearly 800 Bracteates, buried in 1185 in the central city. In 1180, Gotha was first mentioned as a city, when the area between Br\u00fchl and J\u00fcdenstra\u00dfe became the core of urban development, highlighting the early presence of Jews in this old trading town. The parish church of this first urban settlement was St. Mary's Church (demolished in 1530) at Schlossberg. The castle (at the site occupied today by Friedenstein Castle) was first mentioned in 1217. As the Ludowingians died out in 1247, Gotha became part of the Wettins' territories, where it remained until 1918. The new town east of Querstra\u00dfe was established in the early 15th century (with the Neumarkt, first mentioned in 1428). The monastery (first Cistercians, since 1258 Augustinians) was founded before 1251 and abandoned in 1525. Until 1665, the bourse of Gotha was located in the centre of Hauptmarkt square inside the Renaissance building, which hosts the town hall today. The medieval town hall was located on the north-eastern edge of Hauptmarkt, at the site of today's Innungshalle. Water supply was a big problem, because Gotha is not located on a river. In 1369, Landgrave Balthasar had the Leinakanal built. This channel, over 25 kilometres long, brought fresh water from the Thuringian Forest (H\u00f6rsel and Apfelst\u00e4dt rivers) to the city. The main businesses of medieval Gotha were cloth-making and the woad trade. The Reformation was introduced in Gotha in 1524 and the castle was rebuilt as a larger fortress between 1530 and 1541. Gotha was already part of the Ernestine Wettins territory after the 1485 Treaty of Leipzig."}

In later centuries local Pomeranian princes ruled the area, and on both sides of the river they built fortified castles, which were destroyed several times by the Danish invasions in the twelfth century in 1170 and 1173. During the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648) the city became part of the Swedish Empire. The river \u015awina ( ) was formerly flanked by the fishing villages of Westswine and Ostswine. Towards the beginning of the 17th century it was made navigable for large ships. The Kingdom of Prussia gained the area in 1720 from Sweden, and included it in her Pomeranian province. Swinem\u00fcnde was founded on the site of Westswine in 1748, fortified, and received town privileges from King Frederick II of Prussia in 1765. It served as the outer port of Stettin (Szczecin) and was administered within the Province of Pomerania. Swinem\u00fcnde became part of the German Empire after the Kingdom of Prussia completed the unification of Germany in 1871. The town had broad unpaved streets and one-story houses built in the Dutch style, which gave it an almost rustic appearance, although its industries, beyond some fishing, were entirely connected with its shipping. The river mouth, which was the entrance to the harbor, and which was regarded as the best on the Prussian Baltic coast, was then protected by two curving long breakwaters, and was strongly fortified. On the island of Wollin, on the other side of the narrow \u015awina, a great lighthouse was erected. In 1897 the canal of the Kaiserfahrt was opened to navigation, and this waterway between the Stettin harbour and the Baltic Sea was deepened between 1900\u201301. From then on Stettin could be reached directly by ships, and Swinem\u00fcnde's importance diminished somewhat. On 12 March 1945 during World War II, refugee-crowded Swinem\u00fcnde suffered heavy destruction by the USAAF, an estimated 5,000 to 23,000 were killed, most of whom are buried on the Golm War Cemetery west of the town, on the German side of the border.

It was called Dixie by Brigham Young, who was president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. While early settlers cultivated cotton as a commodity crop, they did not succeed in producing it at competitive market rates; consequently, cotton farming was eventually abandoned. More important to the economy was tourism, which developed as the railroads began to carry visitors to the nearby Zion National Park. At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, Brigham Young organized the settlement of what is now Washington County. Fearing that the war would take away the cotton supply, he began plans for raising enough in this southwestern country to supply the needs of his people. Enough favorable reports had come to him from this warm region below the rim of the Great Basin, that he was convinced cotton could be raised successfully here. At the general church conference in Salt Lake City on October 6th, 1861, about three hundred families were \"called\" to the Dixie mission to promote the cotton industry.

Joseph Smith III, son of slain LDS movement founder Joseph Smith, Jr. , moved to Plano in 1866 and ran the church's printing operation from there. As the schism with the Utah branch of the Latter Day Saints deepened, he moved with the church headquarters to Lamoni, Iowa in 1880 to be closer to what the Community of Christ believed to be the true church headquarters at Temple Lot in Missouri rather than in Utah. Community development has been centered around a strong agricultural setting, with the only inhabitants of the area before its incorporation being the owners of grist mills. This development was supported by the city's location along US Route 34 and the Illinois Zephyr Amtrak passenger rail service. The Plano Molding Company, manufacturer of fishing tackle equipment as well as other plastic domestic containment units, has its headquarters in Plano. Both of its original factories within Plano are still in operation, but the main bulk of production is now in nearby cities Sandwich and Mendota.

Blair asked the women to name the town, and they submitted an acronym based upon their first names' initials: Lucy Underhill, Elizabeth Parson, Mary Weare, Anna Blair, Rebecca Smith and Sarah Reynolds. In 1885, Frederick Brooke Close, a young Englishman who had passed up attending Cambridge University to live in Iowa, founded the Northwestern Polo League in Le Mars. During the Great Depression in 1933, at a time when banks were foreclosing on many farmers, Le Mars caught the attention of the nation when \"over five hundred farmers crowded the court room in Le Mars\", according to an account by historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. The farmers were there to demand that Judge Charles C. Bradley suspend foreclosure proceedings until recently passed laws could be considered. Judge Bradley refused. One farmer remarked that the court room wasn't his alone, that farmers had paid for it with their taxes. The crowd rushed the judge, slapped him, and placed a rope around his neck and a hub cap on his head. They did not, however lynch him. Fred H. Wells opened a milk route in Le Mars in 1913. By 1925, Wells and his sons had opened an ice cream manufacturing plant there. However, the plant (and the Wells name) was purchased by Fairmount Ice Cream in 1928.

The name was changed from Usumbura to Bujumbura when Burundi became independent in 1962. Since independence, Bujumbura has been the scene of frequent fighting between the country's two main ethnic groups, with Hutu militias opposing the Tutsi-dominated Burundi army. Bujumbura today stands as an undeveloped city but remains to develop with its country. According to the BBC, Bujumbura residents are known for their \"tradition of Saturday morning runs started during Burundi's long years of ethnic conflict. \" Because the surrounding hills were home to armed militants before 2005, Bujumbura residents \"would try to vent their fear and frustration and claustrophobia, by running, often in a group. \" In March 2014, President Pierre Nkurunziza banned jogging, due to \"fears it was being used as a cover for subversion. \" That same month, twenty-one opposition supporters were sentenced to life in prison for using \"jogging\" as a way to organize \"an illegal demonstration that turned violent. \" As of June 2014 in Bujumbura, \"the authorities have since restricted jogging clubs to certain areas. All sports must now take place in nine parks in Bujumbura and other designated football pitches. \" Bujumbura is governed by a community council and community administrator. It is further divided into 13 communes, or neighborhoods, each with its own council and boss. - Commune of Bujumbura Mairie - Commune of Buterere - Commune of Buyenzi - Commune of Bwiza - Commune of Gihosha - Commune of Ngagara - Commune of Kinindo - Commune of Nyakabiga - Commune of Musaga - Commune of Kanyosha - Commune of Kamenge - Commune of Kinama - Commune of Rohero Bujumbura features a tropical savanna climate (K\u00f6ppen: Aw) with distinct wet and dry seasons.

Bujumbura's central market is in the City Centre, along Rwagasore Avenue. During the city's heavy periods of war in 1972 and 1993, as citizens had become less likely to travel far from the City Centre, markets in neighboring communities lost their business to the central market in Bujumbura.

Tensions rose in the Kenyan side of Moyale in early 1999, after an Imam was shot dead during an Ethiopian raid across the Ethiopian-Kenyan border in pursuit of rebels of the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF). The Kenyan residents of the town, held demonstrations condemning the action, which they attributed to Ethiopian security men who believed he was a sympathizer of the OLF. In November 2009, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi announced plans to extend the Ethiopian railroad to Moyale. This would facilitate Kenyan plans, which at the time were at an advanced stage, to develop the port of Lamu and connect it to the Kenyan side of Moyale with a tarmac road.

It had three sea ports including Pyrgi and Punicum. It was bounded by the two rivers Mola and Manganello, and lay 80 metres above sea level on an outcrop of rocky tuff. The earliest evidence of settlement of the site come from finds of urns at two areas (Cava della Pozzolana and Sorbo) from the 8th and 9th centuries BC and archaeology has revealed the presence of stable employment in the area with housing and related Etruscan necropolis settlements. Trade between the Greeks and Etruscans became increasingly common in the middle of the 8th century BC, with standardised urns and pottery common in graves of the time. The town became the main Etruscan trading centre during the 7th century BC, and trade increased with other Greek colonies in Southern Italy and Sicily, and with the Corinthians. Locally manufactured products began to imitate imported Greek pottery especially after the immigration of Greek artists into Etruria. The oldest examples of Bucchero ceramics come from Caere and it can be assumed that these typical Etruscan ceramics were developed here or produced at least for the first time in large scale. In the Orientalizing Period from around 700 BC the early prosperity of the city is demonstrated in the graves of this period which often contain eastern imports and rich gold finds, notably in the extremely rich Regolini-Galassi tomb with its many fine gold offerings. From 530-500 BC Greek artists were active in the city and worked there for a generation producing color-painted hydras. Burials of the time became increasingly grand, with jewellery and other products of particularly fine manufacture, illustrating the continuing good fortunes of the city. At the height of its prosperity in the 6th century BC, the people of Caere (with the Carthaginians) emerged marginally victorious from clashes with the Phocaean Greeks. Caere had a good reputation among the Greeks for its values and sense of justice, since it abstained from piracy. It was the only Etruscan city to erect its own treasury at Delphi, the \"Agillei Treasury\" dedicated to Pythian Apollo. Since this was generally not allowed to non-Greeks, the legends regarding earlier Greek colonization efforts of the wider area of Caere and Rome seem to have played an important role in allowing such a bold, from a political point of view, act. (Delphi was also a political and intrigue centre for the whole Eastern Mediterranean and Near East area). Caere appears for the first time in documented history in 540 BC concerning the Battle of Alalia in which captured prisoners were stoned to death in the city, an act that was later attributed as the cause of an ensuing plague. In recompense, athletic contests were held every year in the city to honour the dead. In 509 BC, upon the overthrow of the Roman monarchy, the king Lucius Tarquinius Superbus and his two eldest sons Titus and Aruns went into exile in Caere. In spite of the difficulties affecting Etruria during the period, trade once again flourished through the 5th century BC, arguably due to the particularly good relations with the Rome, a traditional ally of the city."}

It has had a post office in operation since 1871. The name \"Mountain Lake\" is usually attributed to early settler, William Mason. The city\u2019s official website recalls, \u201cthe first white settler to the area, William Mason, found a shallow 900-acre lake with three islands. The two smaller islands just broke the water's surface. The third much larger, higher island looked to Mason like a mountain rising from the lake. He named the lake Mountain Lake and the island Mountain Island. \u201d The top of the island was covered with trees, and could be seen for miles around, thus serving as a landmark to early settlers. The story continues that in 1871 the St. Paul & Sioux City Railway had selected \"Midway\" as the name of the village, since it was located midway between Saint Paul, Minnesota and Sioux City, Iowa. However, Mason insisted that the village being platted be named \"Mountain Lake\". Demand for more tillable farmland and construction advances led to the draining of the original lake in 1905-06, which was located in Mountain Lake township, southeast of town. However, in 1937-38 a dam, bridge, and outlet were constructed by the Works Progress Administration at a new site in Midway township to create a new Mountain Lake. This lake, located on the north edge of town, also has an island. The large island of the original lake \u2013 now just a hill amidst the surrounding cornfields \u2013 became a county park which has since 1973 been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Archeological evidence suggests that early settler William Mason was not the first to appreciate the unique qualities of the original lake's island. Artifacts unearthed in a 1976 dig indicated evidence of habitation as early as 500 BC, thus making the location the oldest human habitation yet to be discovered in the state of Minnesota. The coming of the railroad in 1873 played a big role in the expansion of the village. By the time Mountain Lake was formally incorporated in 1886, it had a population of three hundred people, primarily composed of Mennonites immigrating from southern Russia (present-day Ukraine). In 1873, Mennonite immigrants from the Ukraine (at that time, Ukraine was part of Tsarist Russia) began to arrive in Mountain Lake, having been recruited by William Seeger, a member of the Minnesota State Board of Immigration."}

In the Zoroastrian Avesta, the district is mentioned as Haroiva. The name of the district and its main town is derived from that of the chief river of the region, the Herey River (Old Dari Hereyrud, \"Silken Water\"), which traverses the district and passes some south of modern Her\u0101t.

Hamdallah Mustawfi, composer of the 14th century work The Geographical Part of the Nuzhat-al-Qulub writes that: Herodotus described Herat as the bread-basket of Central Asia. At the time of Alexander the Great in 330 BC, Aria was obviously an important district. It was administered by a satrap called Satibarzanes, who was one of the three main Persian officials in the East of the Empire, together with the satrap Bessus of Bactria and Barsaentes of Arachosia. In late 330 BC, Alexander captured the Arian capital that was called Artacoana. The town was rebuilt and the citadel was constructed. Afghanistan became part of the Seleucid Empire after Alexander died, which formed an alliance with the Indian Maurya Empire.

Two tribes dominate this region: the Dagana, nomadic herders, in the interior and the Kouri Kal\u00e9 on the shores and islands of the western part of the lake. The Bulala, who live near Massagory, are said to be Arab in origin. They helped to found the Kanem kingdom, and helped to expel the Kanem royal family in the 13th century. They were later forced to move to the Yao region where they created a small Sultanate and settled into an agricultural lifestyle, although they are said to be good warriors. The French colonialists created the post of Massakory in the Dagana territory in 1901. In 1925 the Bas-Chari region supplied 1,500 workers to work on the Congo-Ocean railway line. During the French colonial era, laws were enforced harshly. In the Massakory circonscription of about 30,000 people in 1932, two percent were in jail. The population of the town of Massakory was 11,344 in 1993, and had increased to 16,237 by 2008. In recent years the town and region has been \"invaded\" from the north by Libyan importers, as have other arid and semi-arid parts of northern Chad. The cattle market, once important, has steadily declined due to the advance of the desert and political instability in the area around the shrinking Lake Chad. The town lies on the Nigeria/Niger corridor of Chad national highway system, running from N'Djamena to Bol. As of 2005, between N'Djamena and Massaguet had been completed, while the remainder of the corridor had yet to start due to lack of funding. By 2008 the paved road had reached Massakory.

It is believed that the town that began as Espa\u00f1ola was named by railroad workers. At the time of railroad construction, a small restaurant in the area was nicknamed \"La Espa\u00f1ola\". This was because of the large presence of Spanish women in the area. The name became official by 1900 and Espa\u00f1ola became a small railroad town. Before the railroads, this is where Spanish and Native American people had settled for hundreds of years, making a living from farming along the Rio Grande. The Espa\u00f1ola area (known as the \"San Juan Valley\" to the early Spaniards) is also known as the first European-founded capital of the \"New World. \" The region was explored In 1598 by Don Juan de O\u00f1ate. He declared the area a capital for Spain, the area of Don Diego de Vargas' new villa at Santa Cruz. O\u00f1ate arrived in the Espa\u00f1ola area on July 11, 1598, at the confluence of the Chama River and the Rio Grande, where he established a camp at a place then called Yunque-Yunque. He created a Spanish settlement in an area already inhabited by the indigenous descendants of the Anasazi. Prior to the arrival of the narrow gauge Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (Chili Line) in 1880, the hamlet on the west-side of the Rio Grande was known as La Vega de los Vigiles in reference to the Vigil family who initially settled that area. The earliest document found indicates that La Vegas de los Vigiles had been populated by 1751, over 100 years before the Chili Line's arrival. With the coming of the railroad the name of the hamlet was changed to Espa\u00f1ola. The Chili Line running predominantly through the Rocky Mountain region announced a route extension of its narrow gauge into northern New Mexico. The line was built along the Rio Grande, and later was known as the Chili Line. The route would extend into what today is the downtown Espa\u00f1ola area, and the railroad began selling lots in the area. Anglo merchants, mountain men, and settlers slowly filtered into Espa\u00f1ola. Frank Bond and his brother George, who were Canadian emigrants, would later arrive in the city.

The remains of a villa or agricultural manor house, workers houses and other associated buildings from the time of the Roman Empire have been found in the underground of the centre of the current city. This villa was rebuilt as a fortified medieval mansion during the High Middle Ages. The history of Fund\u00e3o is intimately related to that of its originally Jewish, then New Christian or Marrano, population. Although the place was already mentioned in documents from 1307 referring 32 houses, the bulk of the population only settled after the 1492 Expulsion of the Jews from Spain by Ferdinand and Isabella, mainly Spanish Jews (sephardic). Close to the border, and already home to significant Jewish minorities the Cova da Beira region, the region received many refugees. They settled in the community of Fund\u00e3o, which their numbers swelled to that of a city. The influx of Jewish artisans and merchants quickly transformed it into an important commercial and industrial center. With the establishment of the Portuguese Inquisition shortly thereafter, many Jews and New Christians were arrested, tortured, executed or had their possessions expropriated. The commercial dynamism of the city was affected. The place was proclaimed a city in 1580 by its notables, after support for their attempt was declared by Dom Ant\u00f3nio, Prior do Crato, to preserve Portuguese independence against the ambitions of King Philip II of Spain (Philip I of Portugal). The Municipal Council and autonomy were granted in 1747. Under the Enlightenment of the late 18th century the Prime-Minister of Portugal, the Marquis of Pombal, legal restraints on the New Christians were abolished and rights equiparated to those of the Old Christians. Pombal tried to recreate the industrial pre\u00ebminence of Fund\u00e3o by founding the Royal Factories (today the City Hall). These efforts allowed a measure of revival to the wool industries of the city, and cloth was again exported to northern Europe. The city decayed again after its sack during the (defeated) Napoleonic French invasions of Portugal, and the following Civil War between supporters of the Liberal Constitutionalist D. Pedro and his brother Conservative Absolutist D. Miguel for the throne."}

The first church was a one-room log cabin, the Wilmington Lutheran Church. It was so named because most of the people who founded Arnegard came from Spring Grove, Minnesota, where they belonged to the Old Wilmington Lutheran Church. The post office was established July 14, 1906 with Gerhard A. Stenehjem as postmaster. The town was incorporated in 1913 when the Great Northern Rail Road extended its line past Watford City to Arnegard. In 1914, the town built the Arnegard School, a one-story, four room school which taught grades 1 through 12. It opened on January 29, 1915. AS second story and rear annex was built in June 1936. Included were four more classrooms and a library on the second floor, and a gym and principal's office in the rear. The annex was torn down in 1954, and a much larger gym built. By then, the Arnegard Spuds basketball team was winning games throughout the state, and wrestlers too were winning awards. In 1961, the school won the State Class C Boys' Basketball Championship. The high school closed in 1963 due to declining enrollment, but elementary school classes continued to be held in the structure until 1976. McKenzie County donated the building to the city of Arnegard shortly thereafter, and it was used as a roller skating rink, town library, and meeting hall. By the early 1980s, the second floor was considered unsafe, and the building eventually closed. In 1998, local man Milton Hanson purchased the structure and completely renovated it. It was then operated as the \"Old School Bed & Breakfast\", and has been featured on HGTV's \"If Walls Could Talk\" and Prairie Public TV's \"Old to New: Remodel, Restore, Revitalize\". In 2015 it was sold, without the bell, and is no longer a bed and breakfast. Arnegard suffered a horrible fire on its Main Street in January 1959."}

During Roman administration it was known as Cusum. After the Romans conquered the region from the Celtic tribe of Scordisci, they built the Cusum fortress where present Petrovaradin Fortress now stands. In addition, the town received its name from the Byzantines, who called it Petrikon or Petrikov (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd) and who presumably named it after Saint Peter. In documents from 1237, the town was first mentioned under the name Peturwarod (P\u00e9terv\u00e1rad), which was named after Hungarian lord Peter, son of T\u00f6re. Petrovaradin was known under the name P\u00e9terv\u00e1rad during Hungarian administration, Varadin or Petervaradin during Ottoman administration, and Peterwardein during Habsburg administration. Today, the municipality is known in Serbo-Croatian as Petrovaradin/\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043d, in Hungarian as P\u00e9terv\u00e1rad, and in German as Peterwardein. Human settlement in the territory of present-day Petrovaradin has been traced as far back as the Stone Age (about 4500 BC). This region was conquered by Celts (in the 4th century BC) and Romans (in the 1st century BC). The Celts founded the first fortress at this location. It was part of the tribal state of the Scordisci, which had its capital in Singidunum (present-day Belgrade). During the Roman administration, a larger fortress was built (in the 1st century) with the name Cusum and was included into Roman Pannonia. Subsequently, the fortress was included into the Pannonia Inferior and the Pannonia Secunda. In the 5th century, Cusum was devastated by the invasion of the Huns. The town was then conquered by Ostrogoths, Gepids, and Lombards. By the end of the 5th century, Byzantines had reconstructed the town and called it by the names Cusum and Petrikon or Petrikov. It was part of the Byzantine province of Pannonia. Subsequently, it passed into the hands of Avars, Franks, Pannonian Croats, Pannonian Slavs, Bulgarians, and Byzantines again. During Bulgarian administration, the town was known as Petrik and was part of the domain of duke Sermon, while during subsequent Byzantine administration, it was part of the Theme of Sirmium. Later, the town was conquered by the Kingdom of Hungary (in the 12th century), by the Ottoman Empire (in 1526), and by the Habsburg Monarchy (in 1687)."}

Clayton prospered during the coal mining boom in eastern Contra Costa County. The post office opened in 1861. Following a previous incorporation attempt in 1960, Clayton incorporated in 1964 in order to stave off an annexation attempt in 1963 of the Cardinet Glen neighborhood by nearby Concord. After steady expansion during the 1970s to the east and west from its original boundaries, Clayton's land area more than doubled in 1987 to near its present-day boundaries with the annexations of the Dana Hills/Dana Ridge and Clayton Wood subdivisions, as well as the former Keller Ranch property that was developed during the 1990s with the Oakhurst Country Club.

Siret (actually the nearby border passing point called Vic\u015faniVadul Siret) is one of the few places in Romania which provides a gauge change equipment, allowing transportation without transfer. Siret is situated at the half distance between Chernivtsi and Suceava, on the right banks of Siret River. The European route E85 crosses the city. During the period 1211\u20131225, on a hill near Siret a fortress was built by the Teutonic Knights. The town and the Teutonic castle were destroyed by the Tatars in 1241. The first document of Siret dates back to 1339, according to some historical sources. The town was the capital of the former principality of Moldavia, in the late 14thcentury. The Russian imperial Army occupied the town in 1770, and, as a consequence, an epidemic of cholera broke out. Together with the rest of Bukovina, Siret was under the imperial rule of the Habsburg Monarchy (later Austria-Hungary) from 1775 to 1918. During World War II, Siret was captured on 3April 1944 by Soviet troops of the 1st Ukrainian Front in the course of the Dnieper\u2013Carpathian Offensive. Given the 14th century decline of the Byzantine empire as Orthodox regional superpower-ally and Latin mendicant orders missions since the 13th century, prince Bogdan I of Moldavia obtained virtual independence in 1359 as founding voivode (autonomous prince), seeking aid and protection from Poland, welcomed Latin missionaries, Francescans (founding a monastery at Siret in 1340) and Dominicans. His son and indirect successor La\u021bcu of Moldavia (1365-1373) promised Rome his and the people's conversion to Catholicism and asked Pope Urban V to send missionaries and erect a Latin diocese in his principality's capital, Siret, which happened in 1371, initially directly subject to the Holy See until 1412 when it was made suffragan of the Archbishopric of Lviv (Lemberg in German; now in Ukraine). This Roman Catholic Diocese of Siret started to decline in 1388 when prince Petru II of Moldavia transferred the Moldavian voivode's capital from Siret to Suceava, and was effectively suppressed, but from circa 1418, the Holy See erected another Moldavian bishopric, the Diocese of Baia, which inherited its territory (1434?). There was a Jewish community by the mid-16th century. Zionist activity began at the turn of the 20thcentury, a time when most of the local Jews worked in commerce. From 1912 to 1918, the mayor was Jewish and the town council included Jews. During World WarI, Jews fled in advance of the Imperial Russian Army, and found their property destroyed when they returned. After the union of Bukovina with Romania, the new authorities revoked licenses for Jewish members of the free professions and removed Jewish officials from their posts."}

Unlike much of the rest of Georgia, Fannin County's first settlers did not come from the east, but from the north. Written accounts date these earliest settlements to 1790. Crossing the Appalachian Mountains to Fort Loudoun (now Tennessee), the first settlers followed the Tennessee River south, where they took the Ocoee-Toccoa River to the wide, fertile river valley that separates the Cohuttas and the Blue Ridge Mountains in Fannin County. Coastal Georgians began to push the Cherokee farther west, and this land was surrendered by the Cherokee in 1835, under the terms of the Treaty of New Echota. In 1838 the Cherokee were forced to leave in the tragedy today known as the Trail of Tears. Fannin County was created in 1854 from portions of Union County and Gilmer, with Morganton as the first county seat. Col. James Fannin, for whom the county is named, was a hero in the Texas War for Independence. Ordered by Sam Houston to pull back from a fortified position in Goliad, Fannin was surrounded by forces under the command of Gen. Jos\u00e9 de Urrea in the Battle of Coleto. Fannin surrendered his force of about 400 men, who later were massacred. According to historic records at the County Historic Cabin near Blue Ridge about early business in Fannin, Appalachian farmers in this area grew products that had to be taken to a mill and \"cracked\" before use, hence the term \"cracker\" was frequently applied to them. Agriculture, and the businesses supporting it, have been a mainstay of the Fannin County economy since its earliest days. A push for diversification at the start of the twentieth century greatly expanded the types of crops raised. From the mid-1800s until the start of the nineteenth century, mining also contributed to the economy, as did lumber from 1900 until World War II. The Marietta and North Georgia Railroad made an economic decision to avoid Fannin's county seat, Morganton, instead building the railroad through the long, relatively flat Toccoa River valley. Col. Mike McKinney founded the town of Blue Ridge in 1886 along the route of the railroad. When the railroad arrived in Fannin County, it gave the county a market for its agricultural products."}

The freed Cossacks fled from Peter I into an area now referred to as the \"Wild Field. \" Some settled in a place near a river and it was named after the abandoned native village - Rovenek. In 1793, Count Vasily Orlor became the owner of the settlement who later became the Cossack chieftain. In 1829, the first literacy school was opened and the first primary school was opened in 1852. At this point, the residents of Rovenky mostly worked the land, raised cattle, and bred sheep. During the World War II, Rovenky was occupied by Nazi Germany. A group of the underground anti-fascist Komsomol (Communist youth) organization Young Guard worked there. During the 1960s and 1970s, there was much development in Rovenky. Many new buildings were built, including the apartment buildings now called \"Shaktyorski,\" \"Gagarin,\" and \"Molodyozh\". \" In the 1990s, private businesses began to appear - trade, transportation, and customer services. The backbone of the community remained its coal enterprises, which account for 95% of all manufactured goods in the city. Since early 2014, Rovenky has been controlled by the Luhansk People's Republic and not by Ukrainian authorities."}

One of the founders of the settlement, Edward Jerningham Wakefield, reported that the settlers \"took up the views of the directors with great cordiality and the new name was at once adopted\". In M\u0101ori, Wellington has three names. Te Whanga-nui-a-Tara refers to Wellington Harbour and means \"the great harbour of Tara\"; P\u014dneke is a transliteration of Port Nick, short for Port Nicholson (the city's central marae, the community supporting it and its kapa haka have the pseudo-tribal name of Ng\u0101ti P\u014dneke); Te Upoko-o-te-Ika-a-M\u0101ui, meaning 'The Head of the Fish of M\u0101ui' (often shortened to Te Upoko-o-te-Ika), a traditional name for the southernmost part of the North Island, deriving from the legend of the fishing up of the island by the demi-god M\u0101ui. In New Zealand Sign Language, the name is signed by raising the index, middle and ring fingers of one hand, palm forward, to form a \"W\", and shaking it slightly from side to side twice. The city's location close to the mouth of the narrow Cook Strait leads to its vulnerability to strong gales, leading to the city's nickname of \"Windy Wellington\". Legends recount that Kupe discovered and explored the district in about the 10th century. The earliest date with hard evidence for Maori living in New Zealand is about 1280. European settlement began with the arrival of an advance party of the New Zealand Company on the ship Tory on 20 September 1839, followed by 150 settlers on the Aurora on 22 January 1840. The settlers constructed their first homes at Petone (which they called Britannia for a time) on the flat area at the mouth of the Hutt River. When that proved swampy and flood-prone they transplanted the plans, which had been drawn without regard for the hilly terrain. In 1865, Wellington became the capital city in place of Auckland, which William Hobson had made the capital in 1841. The New Zealand Parliament had first met in Wellington on 7 July 1862, on a temporary basis; in November 1863, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Alfred Domett, placed a resolution before Parliament in Auckland that \". it has become necessary that the seat of government. should be transferred to some suitable locality in Cook Strait [region]. \" Apparently, there had been some concerns that the more populous South Island (where the goldfields were located) would choose to form a separate colony in the British Empire. Several Commissioners invited from Australia, chosen for their neutral status, declared that Wellington was a suitable location because of its central location in New Zealand and good harbour. Parliament officially met in Wellington for the first time on 26 July 1865. At that time, the population of Wellington was just 4,900."}

Archaeological research of the Institute for monuments protection from Cetinje in 1956, it was discovered that traces of materialculture from Neolithic period exist in Berane valley. In addition, traces of the Illyrian culture were found also, so it can be assumed that the environment of Andrijevica was ecumenical space of numerous groups of people. Remainders of Roman settlements are also present in Berane valley, as well as in the vicinity of Andrijevica town. During the Middle ages, the fort of Grace existed, 1 km from today's town of Andrijevica. The fort was probably guarding the road along the Lim River, which was part of the main road network between Ra\u0161ka and Zeta. This period saw emergence of a number of smaller villages and settlements, all of which predate the Andrijevica town. During the rule of House of Nemanji\u0107, it was noted that the area of Andrijevica was densely populated with Orthodox Christian population. In the Nemanji\u0107 era, the center of the area was Budim grad, some 15 km from today's town. A descendant of the Nemanji\u0107 house, Andrija, built a church called Andrijevina, which was razed by the Ottomans in 1765. In nineteenth century, the warrior tribe of Vasojevi\u0107i, which was frequently rebelling against Ottoman rule, began forming a settlement around the new church of Andrijevina, which will eventually become Andrijevica. In 1858, Vasojevi\u0107 Duke Miljan Vukov proclaims Vasojevi\u0107i region a part of Montenegro. From that point, the settlement gradually expands into town, but World War I interrupt its development.

The Great Republic claim, found by Thomas Ryan and Philip Creasor on March 5, 1896, was the highest producer of gold. By 1900 the settlement was booming. A post office was established but postal authorities rejected the name Eureka because there was already a town by that name in Clark County, Washington. The citizens then decided to honor the Great Republic mining claim by proposing the name Republic. This name was accepted and the settlement was incorporated as a city on May 22, 1900. Republic's prominence, initially brought on by the gold rush, started to fade as prospectors and those who supported the mining industry moved away. During the years between 1900 and 1910, the town lost over half its population. Despite this, mining has continued to be an important part of life in Republic, as gold is still mined for in the mountains surrounding the town. Mining is celebrated in the local Prospector's Days, held during the second weekend in June, where locals honor their prospector roots by competing in mining and logging competitions, panning for gold, and watching an old west gun fight. Today, the town of 1,100 is mainly sustained by those people in surrounding farms and ranches, miners who work at the local mine, and tourists looking for a quieter, slower pace of life. Republic is also the site of the Stonerose Interpretive Center and Fossil Site, famous for the Eocene fossils found in a 49 mya lake bed at the north end of Republic. At the Ferry County Fairgrounds, located three miles (5 km) east of town on State Route 20, is the Ferry County Carousel originally built between 1895 and 1900. Republic has many businesses that line Clark Ave (the main street through town) including Anderson's Grocery, which is over a hundred years old. The Kinross Gold company and Ferry County Memorial Hospital are two of largest employers in the County. Republic is located at (48. 648159, \u2212118."}

Only in 1486 could the Count Ludwig of Isenburg finally take control of city for his family, and 1556 Count Reinhard of Isenburg relocated his Residence to Offenbach, building a palace, the Isenburger Schlo\u00df (Isenburg Palace), which was completed in 1559. It was destroyed by fire in 1564 and rebuilt in 1578. In 1635 Offenbach given to the Landgraves of Hesse-Darmstadt but it was returned to the Isenburg-Birstein Count (later Prince) in 1642 and remained in that Principality until 1815 when the Congress of Vienna gave the city to the Austrian Emperor, Francis I. A year later it was given to the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt. Always very close to the city centre of Frankfurt, Offenbach was a popular location for business. The town has its own trade fair, and many companies have opened facilities here because there are fewer restrictions and no closed businesses. French Protestants (Huguenots) came in the 17th century and settled in Offenbach and contributed to making Offenbach a prosperous city, e. g. , bringing knowledge of tobacco with them and turning Offenbach into a centre for rolling cigars. The town was more cosmopolitan than Frankfurt; famous people such as Goethe and Mozart visited it several times. The Rumpenheim Palace and its park were a popular destination for monarchs in the 19th century. The city was thereafter ruled by Grand Dukes of Hesse and by Rhine until the monarchy was abolished in 1918. Offenbach became the center of the traditional design with figures such as the architect Hugo Eberhardt, the typographer Rudolf Koch, the bookbinder and designer Ignatz Wiemeler and Ernst Engel and the painter Karl Friedrich Lippmann."}

Dacian coins found in archaeological perimeters of the city central area and on the Valea M\u00e2\u021bii, west of the city , plus important items belonging to Roman culture, are evidence of free Dacian continuity in this area and of developing economic relations with the Roman ancient city of Porolissum. After the conquest of Dacia by Trajan (106), the Roman Empire border stood atop the Mese\u0219 Mountains, just 5 km away from the city. Just north from the border, on the actual Zal\u0103u city area were the free Dacians tribes, and to the east, south-east (of Mese\u0219 Mountains) were Roman border fortifications, towers, walls, ditches and defense sides. The first written mention about Zal\u0103u, was in the \"Gesta Hungarorum\", also called the \"Chronicle of Anonymous\" (probably notary of the King B\u00e9la III of Hungary), published around year 1200. According to this source, Zal\u0103u settlement would have been there as early as around 900. Later, Zal\u0103u is referred to as Villa Ziloc in 1220, Zylac in 1246, Zylah in 1282, Zyloh and oppidum Zylah in 1318, Zila in 1601, Zilahu in 1808, Szil\u00e1j / Szil\u00e1gyi in 1839, Szilaju in 1850, and Zal\u0103u / Szil\u00e1ju / Walthenberg in 1854. After the great Mongol invasion, which destroyed the city in 1241, Zal\u0103u came in 1246 under the administration of the Catholic Bishopric of Oradea. The trusteeship was maintained until 1542, when Zal\u0103u became part of Principality of Transylvania. On August 1, 1473 Matthias Corvinus, king of Hungary and Bohemia, acknowledged Zal\u0103u as a market town for the first time (called oppidum Zilah \u2013 Zilah fort), a privilege that freed the city from the county domination, granted its citizens the right of free trade and gave it a larger degree of economic autonomy. At the end of the 16th century, the city had an independent administrative leadership, composed of 33 elected senators (one of whom was the mayor), a notary, a registrar and a treasurer. Other important events in the development of the city occurred in 1571 during the reign of Prince Istvan Bathory and in 1600 under the reign of Michael the Brave. After Transylvania had been annexed to the Habsburg Empire, the city experienced an economic decline due to infusion of products from the Western Europe. After Michael the Brave's victory in the Battle of Gurusl\u0103u on August 3, 1601, Zal\u0103u received administrative, legislative, fiscal and military own rules, which provided real autonomy freedoms to citizens. A chronicle from the 17th century, first mentioned the main crafts of city residents: belt-makers, potters, wheelwrights, shoemakers, butchers, tailors, blacksmiths, carpenters, hat makers and armorers. The city was under the rule Principality of Transylvania between 1526\u20131660. It was also controlled by the Ottomans between 1660\u20131692, the city being part of Varat Eyalet."}

It is sometimes claimed that Sausalito was named for the district in Valpara\u00edso, Chile where the bandit Joaqu\u00edn Murrieta was born. Murrieta was the leader of bandits who settled at the northern end of the future Golden Gate bridge after being banned from San Francisco in the bandit wars. However, this theory cannot be true because Murrieta was from Mexico, not Chile, and because he did not arrive in California until the Gold Rush around 1849.

A full 21. 54% of the city (0. 5 square miles, or 1. 3 km\u00b2) is under water, and has been so since its founding in 1868. Prominent geographic features associated with Sausalito include Richardson Bay and Pine Point. When Sausalito was formally platted, it was anticipated that future development might extend the shoreline with landfill, as had been the practice in neighboring San Francisco. As a result, entire streets, demarcated and given names like Pescadero, Eureka and Teutonia, remain beneath the surface of Richardson Bay. The legal, if not actual, presence of these streets has proved a contentious factor in public policy, because some houseboats float directly above them. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, \"State agencies say privately owned houseboats can't be located above the underwater streets because the streets are public trust lands intended for public benefit. \" The California State Lands Commission is reportedly pursuing a compromise which would move not the houseboats, but the theoretical streets instead. Sausalito has a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csb) with far lower temperatures than expected because of its adjacency to San Francisco Bay and the resultant onshore breezes. Sausalito was once the site of a Coast Miwok settlement known as Liwanelowa."}

But then a rich lords daughter drowned in the river. The girl\u2019s name was Gallimh which they named the river but they changed it to Gaillimh. Years later they named the city Gaillimh and returned the name of the river to the Corrib. Historically, the name was Anglicised as Galliv or Gallive, closer to the Irish pronunciation. The city's name in Latin is Galvia. The city also bears the nickname \"City of the Tribes\" ( ) because of the fourteen merchant families called the \"tribes of Galway\" who led the city in its Hiberno-Norman period. Residents of the city refer to themselves as Galwegians. D\u00fan Gaillimhe (\"Fort at the Mouth (bottom) of the Gaillimh\") was constructed in 1124, by the King of Connacht, Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair (1088\u20131156). A settlement grew around it. During the Norman invasion of Connacht in the 1230s, D\u00fan Gaillimhe was captured by Richard Mor de Burgh, who had led the invasion. As the de Burghs eventually became Gaelicised, the merchants of the town, the Tribes of Galway, pushed for greater control over the walled city. This led to their gaining complete control over the city and to the granting of mayoral status by the English crown in December 1484. Galway endured difficult relations with its Irish neighbours. A notice over the west gate of the city, completed in 1562 by Mayor Thomas \u00d3ge Martyn, stated \"From the Ferocious O'Flahertys may God protect us\". A by-law forbade the native Irish (as opposed to Galway's Hiberno-Norman citizens) unrestricted access into Galway, saying \"neither O\u2019 nor Mac shall strutte nor swagger through the streets of Galway\" without permission. During the Middle Ages, Galway was ruled by an oligarchy of fourteen merchant families (twelve who claimed to be of Norman origin and two of Irish origin). These were the \"Tribes of Galway\"."}

Lae was declared a town under the New Guinea Boundaries Ordinance on 31 March 1931 at the height of the gold rush era and Lae became the prototype for New Guinean towns built up around airstrips. The Europeans lived to the East of Lae Airfield while the New Guineans lived to the West. Cargo arrived in Lae and then was transported by air to the goldfields in Wau. In July 1937, Lae made world news when American aviator Amelia Earhart was last seen flying out of the airport on her way back to the United States. She was never seen again. When the volcanic eruptions occurred in Rabaul in 1937, a decision was made to transfer the capital of the Territory of New Guinea to Lae. World War II impeded the transfer and the town was occupied by the Empire of Japan on 8 March 1942. Lae, Rabaul and Salamaua became the major Japanese bases in New Guinea. The naval Battle of the Bismarck Sea in March 1943 was fought over the Japanese attempt to reinforce Lae with troops sent by sea from Rabaul, an attempt foiled by sustained Allied attack on the Japanese troop transports.

Archaeologists have found pre-historic rock art on the city's outskirts, in Buur Heybe. During the Middle Ages, Baidoa and its surrounding area was part of the influential polity that covered much of southern Somalia and eastern Ethiopia, with its domain extending from Mareeg in the north, to Qelafo in the west, to Kismayo in the south. In the early modern period, the Baidoa area was ruled by the Geledi Sultanate. The kingdom was eventually incorporated into Italian Somaliland in 1908, and ended in 1910 with the death of its last Sultan Osman Ahmed. After independence in 1960, the city was made the center of the official Baidoa District. Baidoa later incurred significant damage in the early 1990s, following the start of the civil war. In September 1995, United Somali Congress militia attacked and occupied the town. They remained in control of Baidoa until around January 1996, while the local Rahanweyn Resistance Army militia continued to engage the USC in the town's environs. In 1999, the RRA seized control of the wider Bay and Bakool provinces. The town and larger region gradually rebounded to become among the more stable areas in the south. In 2002, the RRA's leader Hasan Muhammad Nur Shatigadud founded the Southwestern State of Somalia regional administration, with its headquarters in Baidoa. The creation of the autonomous state was a move to show the RRA leadership's disaffection with the nascent Mogadishu-based Transitional National Government, which had been established two years earlier. In 2005, the Southwestern State was officially dissolved after its leader Shatigadud had joined the Transitional Federal Parliament in November 2004 and later became Minister of Finance in January 2005 in the Transitional Federal Government (TFG), the TNG's successor. In early 2005, the TFG sent official delegations to Baidoa and Jowhar to assess the suitability of each city as a temporary headquarters for the TFG before an eventual relocation of government offices to Mogadishu. In June\u2013July 2005, the Transitional Federal Government established an interim seat in Jowhar due to ongoing insecurity in the capital. To strengthen its presence in the town, the central authorities built an improved airport and inaugurated the Duduble Canal. The TFG later moved its temporary headquarters to Baidoa. In December 2006, Ethiopian troops entered Somalia to assist the TFG against the advancing Islamic Courts Union, initially winning the Battle of Baidoa. On 28 December 2006, the allied forces recaptured the capital from the ICU."}

The settlement was used as a capital by the Arsacids called Rhaga. In Classical Greco-Roman geography it was called Rhagae (Greek: ). It is mentioned several times in the Apocrypha. Its name dates back to the pre-Median period. Some historians attribute its building to ancient mythological monarchs, and some others believe that Ray was the seat of a dynasty of Zoroastrian leader. During the Seleucid period, Alexander the Great's general Seleucus I Nicator renamed the city as Europos, honouring his home city in Macedonia. Rey is also shown on the 4th century Peutinger Map. Ray is richer than many other ancient cities in the number of its historical monuments, among which one might refer to the 3000-year-old Gebri castle, the 5000-year-old Cheshmeh Ali hill, the 1000-year-old Bibi Shahr Banoo tomb and Shah Abbasi caravanserai. It has been home to pillars of science like Rhazes. Rey was one of the capital cities of the Seljuq Empire in the 11th century. In the 13th century after the Mongol conquest the town was severely damaged and it gradually lost its importance in the presence of nearby Tehran. There is also a shrine there, dedicated to commemorate Princess Shahr Banu, eldest daughter of the last ruler of the Sassanid Empire. She gave birth to Ali Zayn al Abidin, the fourth holy Imam of the Shia faith. This was through her marriage to Husayn ibn Ali, the grandson of Muhammad, the prophet of Islam. A nearby mountain is also named after her. However, some sources attribute the shrine to the goddess of water and fertility, Anahita, claiming it was renamed in Islamic times to protect it from any possible harm after the conversion of Iranians to Islam. In the middle of the 19th century Ray was described as place of ruins, the only settlement being around the shrine of Abdol Azim. Being the only important pilgrimage site in vicinity to the royal court in the new capital Tehran brought more people to visit the shrine and a major restoration was sponsored by the court. Thus Ray was the first place in Iran to be connected to the capital by a railroad in 1888."}

The second sale was held on July 18, 1907, and final lots were sold on March 25, 1908, by the Blanchard Townsite Company. Within a year the town was described as having forty business establishments, including a state and national bank, four blacksmith shops, three livery barns, two grain elevators, and a weekly newspaper. Several incorporation dates are reported in various publications pertaining to the history of Blanchard, and in the town offices as well. The most reliable source seems to be the Blanchard Record of October 25, 1907, which reported, \"That Blanchard is now an incorporated town is realized by but a few of our citizens. The petition praying for incorporation was favorably acted upon at the [federal] courts at Chickasha [sic] last week. On or about November 19 notice of an election of officers will be given. In the meantime candidates will be chosen. \" A population of 629 was reported by 1910, and 1,040 in 1930. The Blanchard post office charter was granted by the Post Office Department on December 19, 1906. Mail had previously been received at Womack. When Arthur H. \"Art\" and Bill Blanchard moved their store from Womack to the new townsite in 1906, they took the post office with them. In 1909, the Northern District Court was established whereby McClain County was divided into two sections for legal matters for the convenience of the citizens. A court house was built in Blanchard, and the first case began on December 13, 1909."}

Before he arrived in San Antonio to meet with the governor, they learned that Mexico had earned its independence from Spain, making Texas a Mexican province rather than a Spanish province. Governor Martinez assured him, however, that the new Mexican government would honor the colonization contract. Stephen returned to Louisiana to recruit settlers. He offered land at 12. 5 cents per acre, only 10% of what comparable acreage sold for in the United States. Settlers would pay no customs duties for seven years and would not be subject to taxation for ten years. In return, they would be expected to become Mexican citizens. In March 1822, Austin learned that the new Mexican government had not ratified his father's land grant with Spain. He was forced to travel to Mexico City, away, to get permission for his colony. The 1823 Imperial Colonization Law of Mexico allowed an empresario to receive a land grant within the Mexican province of Texas. The empresario and a commissioner appointed by the governor would be authorized the distribute land to settlers and issue them titles in the name of the Mexican government. Only one contract was ultimately approved under this legislation, the first contract granted to Stephen F. Austin. Between 1824 and 1828, Austin granted 297 titles under this contract. Each head of household received a minimum of 177 acres or 4,428 acres depending on whether they intended to farm or raise livestock. The grant could be increased for large families or those wishing to establish a new industry, but the lands would be forfeited if they were not cultivated within two years. The settlers who received their titles under Stephen's first contract were known as the Old Three Hundred, and they made up the first organized, approved influx of Anglo-American immigrants to Texas. The new titles were located in an area where no Spanish or Mexican settlements had existed, covering the land between the Brazos River and the Colorado River from the Gulf Coast to the San Antonio Road. The capital of this new colony was San Felipe de Austin, now the town of San Felipe in Austin County."}

Nashua lies approximately in the center of the original 1673 grant. In 1732, Dunstable was split along the Merrimack River, with the town of Nottingham (now the town of Hudson, New Hampshire) created out of the eastern portion. The previously disputed boundary between Massachusetts and New Hampshire was fixed in 1741 when the governorships of the two provinces were separated. As a consequence, the township of Dunstable was divided in two. Tyngsborough and some of Dunstable remained in Massachusetts, while Dunstable, New Hampshire, was incorporated in 1746 from the northern section of the town. Located at the confluence of the Nashua and Merrimack rivers, Dunstable was first settled about 1654 as a fur trading town. Like many 19th century riverfront New England communities, it would be developed during the Industrial Revolution with textile mills operated from water power. By 1836, the Nashua Manufacturing Company had built three cotton mills which produced 9. 3 million yards of cloth annually on 710 looms. On December 31, 1836, the New Hampshire half of Dunstable was renamed \"Nashua\", after the Nashua River, by a declaration of the New Hampshire legislature (the Dunstable name lives on across the Massachusetts border). The Nashua River was named by the Nashuway Indians, and in the Penacook language it means \"beautiful stream with a pebbly bottom\", with an alternative meaning of \"land between two rivers\". In 1842 the town split again in two for eleven years following a dispute between the area north of the Nashua, and the area south of the river. During that time the northern area (today \"French Hill\") called itself \"Nashville\", while the southern part kept the name Nashua. They reconciled in 1853 and joined together to charter the \"city of Nashua\". Six railroad lines crossed the mill town, namely the Boston, Lowell and Nashua; Worcester and Nashua; Nashua and Acton; Nashua and Wilton; Concord and Nashua; and Rochester railroads; with 56 trains entering and departing daily in the years before the Civil War. These various railroads led to all sections of the country, north, east, south, and west. The Jackson Manufacturing Company employed hundreds of workers in the 1870s. Like the rival Amoskeag Manufacturing Company upriver in Manchester, the Nashua mills prospered until about World War I, after which a slow decline set in. Water power was replaced with newer forms of energy to run factories."}

Kfar Saba appears in the Talmud in connection to corn tithing and the Capharsaba sycamore fig tree. Kfar Saba is mentioned in the Mosaic of Rehob, the oldest known Talmudic text, which dates from around the 3rd century C. E. Excavations on the site have revealed the remains of a large Roman bathhouse. In the Byzantine periods the ruins of the bathhouse were first converted into fish pools, and later into some form of industrial installation. Following the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 7th century, the Arab village of Kafr Saba was established in the area. Around 985 C. E. Al-Muqaddasi described it as a village with a large mosque on the road to Damascus. In 1047, Nasir-i-Khusraw described it as a town on the road to Ramla rich in fig and olive trees. The village continued to exist during the Ottoman Empire's rule over the Levant. In 1596, Kafr Saba was inhabited by 42 Muslim families. In the 1870s it was described as \"a mud village of moderate size with mud-ponds around it and good water in the wells of Neby Yemin, to the east. \" In 1898, the Jewish town of Kfar Saba was established as a moshava on 7,500 dunams of land purchased from the Arab village. Despite attractive advertisements in Jerusalem and London, attempts to sell plots to private individuals were unsuccessful, as the land was located in a desolate, neglected area far from any other Jewish settlement. The Ottoman pasha of Nablus, to whose governorate the land belonged, refused to give building permits, therefore the first settlers lived in huts made of clay and straw. They earned their living by growing almonds, grapes and olives. A well was dug in 1906."}

Serum-Konzentrationen verschiedener Enzyme, die bei einer Sch\u00e4digung oder Untergang von Muskelfasern frei werden, und weitere muskelspezifische Werte erlauben es, den aktuellen Stand einzusch\u00e4tzen. Dazu z\u00e4hlen die Muskelenzyme der Creatin-Kinase (CK-Mi, CK-B, CK-M, CK-MB), Lactatdehydrogenase, Aldolase und Glutamat-Oxalazetat-Transferase (SGOT) und das Myoglobin Teilweise findet man bei Patienten auch erh\u00f6hte Werte bei Myositis-spezifischen Antik\u00f6rpern, mit jedoch ungekl\u00e4rter pathophysiologischer Relevanz, die au\u00dferdem oft mit anderen Erkrankungen vergesellschaftet sind. So k\u00f6nnen beispielsweise Antisynthetaseantik\u00f6rper (Jo-1, Pl-7, Pl-12, OJ, EJ) auf eine Myositis, fibrosierende Alveolitis, oder eine Arthritis hindeuten. Anti-SRP, Anti-Mi-2, Anti-PmScl, Anti-U1-RNP und Anti-Ku sind ebenfalls Indikatoren f\u00fcr eine Myositis, aber auch f\u00fcr andere Erkrankungen. Wegen der nicht gegebenen Spezifit\u00e4t der oben genannten Untersuchungsmethoden ist eine Muskelbiopsie das wichtigste Entscheidungskriterium. Evident ist hierbei die Wahl des richtigen Orts f\u00fcr die Biopsie, was oft schon im Vorfeld bildgebende Ma\u00dfnahmen, oft eine Magnetresonanztomographie erfordert. Eine anschlie\u00dfende pathologische Untersuchung kann dann erstmals sicher zwischen den einzelnen Myositisformen differenzieren."}

So sinkt der extrazellul\u00e4re K-Gehalt bei einem pH-Anstieg von 0,1 um ca. 0,4 mmol/L. Eine weitere Ursache ist der renale Kaliumverlust im Rahmen einer sog. Kaliumverlustniere. Eine Bariumvergiftung kann ebenfalls zu einer schweren Hypokali\u00e4mie f\u00fchren.

Der Begriff wird unabh\u00e4ngig von der erotischen Konnotation meist im Sinne eines \u201everehrungsw\u00fcrdigen Gegenstandes\u201c oder dem der Idolatrie verwendet. Es verstehen sich auch die in der Umgangssprache verwendeten Wortsch\u00f6pfungen wie \u201eOrdnungsfetisch\u201c(-ismus), \u201eParagrafenfetisch\u201c oder \u201eSauberkeitsfetisch\u201c. Diese spielen sowohl mit der urspr\u00fcnglichen Bedeutung des Fetischismus als auch mit der sexuellen Note. Der Begriff Fetischismus wird in verschiedenen Kontexten in unterschiedlichen Bedeutungen gebraucht: Dabei gibt es zum Teil erhebliche Unterschiede zwischen dem umgangssprachlichen Gebrauch des Wortes und dem wissenschaftlichen Term. Mitunter werden allgemein sexuelle Neigungen als sexueller Fetisch bezeichnet, worin manche Praktizierende eine Diskriminierung sehen. Eine klare begriffliche Unterscheidung wird auf der einen Seite angestrebt, um ein im Verst\u00e4ndnis der Medizin, der Rechtsprechung und der entsprechenden Subkultur erweitertes normales Sexualverhalten von behandlungsbed\u00fcrftigen Problemf\u00e4llen abzugrenzen, ist jedoch auf der anderen praktisch nicht konsensual zu treffen. Der Begriff bezeichnete urspr\u00fcnglich das Konzept eines religi\u00f6sen Fetischismus bei sogenannten \u201eNaturv\u00f6lkern\u201c. Ausgangspunkt war die Verehrung lebloser, mit \u201e\u00fcbernat\u00fcrlichen Kr\u00e4ften\u201c geladener Gegenst\u00e4nde \u2013 sogenannter Fetische \u2013 in einigen westafrikanischen ethnischen Religionen. Die weitreichende \u00dcbertragung auf andere Ethnien und Kulturen als Fetischismus wurde jedoch wieder aufgegeben. 1887 wurde diese Bedeutung vom franz\u00f6sischen Psychologen Alfred Binet mit seiner Arbeit \u201eLe F\u00e9tichisme dans l\u2019amour. \u201c in der \u201eRevue Philosophique\u201c auf den Bereich des Sexuallebens ausgedehnt. Lange Zeit blieb der Begriff von der nicht wissenschaftlich interessierten Bev\u00f6lkerung unbeachtet, w\u00e4hrend dessen Bedeutung in Fachkreisen erweitert wurde; bereits 1912 nannte beispielsweise Richard von Krafft-Ebing die sexuelle Hingabe an einen einzelnen K\u00f6rperteil Fetischismus. Durch die psychoanalytischen Betrachtungen Sigmund Freuds, die auch Nichtmediziner erreichten, wurde der Begriff \u201eFetischismus\u201c nach 1927 popul\u00e4r. Hierbei wurde der sexuelle Fetischismus als eine krankhafte Abweichung verstanden. Zur Verbreitung des Begriffs trug auch die von Karl Marx gepr\u00e4gte Idee des \u201eWarenfetisch\u201c bei, die zwar auf den religi\u00f6sen Fetischismus gr\u00fcndete und nicht sexuell konnotiert war, aber das Wort Fetisch in seiner Doppeldeutigkeit weiter publik machte. Im Zuge der sexuellen Revolution ver\u00e4nderte sich das Verst\u00e4ndnis menschlicher Sexualit\u00e4t grundlegend: Es war nicht mehr akzeptabel, alle von der Norm abweichenden sexuellen Haltungen als psychische Krankheiten zu werten. Die Definition des medizinischen-psychologischen Fachbegriffs Fetischismus wurde zusammen mit dem der Paraphilie deutlich st\u00e4rker abgegrenzt. Nach heutigem Verst\u00e4ndnis ist Fetischismus nicht im Rahmen der sexuellen Orientierung an sich eine psychische St\u00f6rung, sondern nur dann als behandlungsbed\u00fcrftige St\u00f6rung zu verstehen, wenn der Betroffene unter ihren Auswirkungen leidet."}

Bei gleichzeitigem Diabetes mellitus oder einer Neuropathie anderer Ursache sind die Ver\u00e4nderungen wohl schmerz\u00e4rmer oder schmerzlos, k\u00f6nnen aber umso schwerwiegendere Ver\u00e4nderungen nach sich ziehen und durch Fistel- und Ulkusbildung zu einem Malum perforans sowie durch Infektionen zu einer diabetischen Gangr\u00e4n der Zehen oder des Fu\u00dfes f\u00fchren. Eine Behandlung wird zweckm\u00e4\u00dfig mit einem etwa 20 Minuten dauernden Fu\u00dfbad in warmem Wasser eingeleitet. Dadurch wird die Haut eingeweicht und kann unterhalb des Sporns abgel\u00f6st und dieser dadurch freigelegt werden. Nach dieser Vorbehandlung kann man eine Salicyls\u00e4ure-haltige L\u00f6sung oder ein mit Salicyls\u00e4ure getr\u00e4nktes Pflaster auftragen. An die Grenzen der Selbstbehandlung geht das Aufritzen und Abziehen der Hornhautschichten mit einem Messer, z. B. einem speziellen H\u00fchneraugenmesser.

W\u00e4hrend eines Ausbruchs k\u00f6nnen verschiedene Virusst\u00e4mme kozirkulieren. Eine \u00dcbertragung des Erregers erfolgt direkt von Mensch zu Mensch durch direkten Kontakt mit K\u00f6rperfl\u00fcssigkeiten wie Speichel, Tr\u00f6pfchen, dem Sekret aus Bl\u00e4schen oder f\u00e4kal-oral, in den ersten Tagen der Infektion auch aus Bl\u00e4schen der Mundschleimhaut \u00fcber Aerosole beim Husten des Erkrankten.

Aufgrund der sicheren klinischen Diagnose und des milden Verlaufs wird in den meisten F\u00e4llen keine Labordiagnostik eingeleitet.

Als Hohlkreuz oder Hyperlordose wird eine Fehlhaltung mit \u00fcbertriebener Lordose der Lendenwirbels\u00e4ule bezeichnet, bei der sich die Bauchpartie durch die Verlagerung des Beckens nach vorne vorw\u00f6lbt. Um nicht nach vorne zu fallen, wird der Brustkorb hinter die K\u00f6rperachse verlagert (Brustkyphose). Die Bauchmuskulatur verhindert das Umkippen nach hinten, indem sie in der Dehnung dauerhaft angespannt wird. Ausl\u00f6ser kann zum einen eine durch Bewegungsmangel oder falsche K\u00f6rperhaltung mangelhaft trainierte, verk\u00fcrzte hypertone R\u00fcckenmuskulatur sein, die die Funktion der Bauchmuskeln als Gegenspieler hemmt, indem sie sich nicht entspannt.

Kennzeichnend ist ein so pl\u00f6tzlicher starker Harndrang, dass oft die Toilette nicht mehr erreicht werden kann, bevor es zu einem unfreiwilligen Urinverlust kommt. Grund sind zum Beispiel Kontraktionen der Blasenleerungs-Muskulatur, h\u00e4ufig verursacht durch lokale entz\u00fcndliche Prozesse (z. B. Blasenentz\u00fcndungen), \u00dcbergewicht, Diabetes mellitus oder durch Sch\u00e4den der diese Muskeln steuernden Nerven, wie zum Beispiel bei der Alzheimer-Krankheit, Multiplen Sklerose, Parkinson-Krankheit oder nach einem Schlaganfall. Von der mit unfreiwilliger Detrusorkontraktion (Kontraktionen der Blasenleerungs-Muskulatur) verbundenen motorischen Dranginkontinenz wird eine sensorische Dranginkontinenz ohne Detrusorkontraktion unterschieden. Bei einer Belastungsinkontinenz l\u00f6st der erh\u00f6hte Bauchinnendruck durch Belastung, Pressen aus den verschiedensten Gr\u00fcnden (Heben, Tragen, Treppensteigen, Lachen, Husten, Niesen, Entweichen von Darmgasen) den mehr oder weniger ausgepr\u00e4gten unfreiwilligen Harnabgang aus. Es werden drei Schweregrade nach Stamey unterschieden: Bei Frauen ist die Belastungsinkontinenz oft Folge mehrfacher Geburten, die zu einer \u00dcberdehnung und Erschlaffung von Halteb\u00e4ndern und des Beckenbodens f\u00fchren. Daraus resultiert eine Senkung (Descensus) der Organe des kleinen Beckens. Dann wirkt ein erh\u00f6hter Bauchinnendruck zwar noch in voller St\u00e4rke auf die Harnblase, kann aber gleichzeitig die Harnr\u00f6hre nicht mehr erreichen und deren Verschlussdruck nicht mehr unterst\u00fctzen. Beim Mann dagegen ist diese Form der Inkontinenz meist Folge einer traumatischen Sch\u00e4digung des \u00e4u\u00dferen Blasenschlie\u00dfmuskels durch Operationen (z. B. radikale Prostatektomie) oder Unf\u00e4lle. Therapeutisch stehen bei der weiblichen Stressinkontinenz in leichten F\u00e4llen konservative Behandlungsm\u00f6glichkeiten im Vordergrund. Dazu eignet sich zum Beispiel das Antidepressivum Duloxetin. In schwereren F\u00e4llen stehen eine Reihe von operativen Methoden zur Verf\u00fcgung. Erste Operationen der Belastungsinkontinenz wurden 1878 publiziert."}

Daher r\u00fchrt die umgangssprachliche Bezeichnung \u201eHornhautverkr\u00fcmmung\u201c. Dar\u00fcber hinaus gibt es den selteneren Linsenastigmatismus. Er kann entweder durch eine Oberfl\u00e4che ausgel\u00f6st werden, die nicht rein sph\u00e4risch ist, oder akkommodativ bedingt sein durch eine unterschiedliche Kontraktion des Ziliarmuskels. Gibt es Differenzen der optischen Dichte innerhalb der Linsenschichten, kann es zu einem refraktiven Linsenastigmatismus kommen. Zudem kennt man einen seltenen Astigmatismus des Augenhintergrunds, etwa bei hoher Myopie. Der Gesamtastigmatismus eines Auges setzt sich aus den zuvor genannten Einzelastigmatismen zusammen. Den gr\u00f6\u00dften Einfluss auf den Gesamtastigmatismus hat auf Grund des hohen Brechzahlunterschiedes die Hornhaut. Hornhauterkrankungen, wie der Keratokonus und der Keratoglobus, f\u00fchren h\u00e4ufig zu starken und irregul\u00e4ren Astigmatismen und dar\u00fcber hinaus auch zu anderen Abbildungsfehlern.

Liegt eine Brennlinie des Astigmatismus in der Netzhautebene, w\u00e4hrend sich die andere dahinter befindet, spricht man von einem Astigmatismus hyperopicus simplex, liegt sie davor von einem Astigmatismus myopicus simplex. Befindet sich eine Brennlinie vor, die andere hinter der Netzhautebene, handelt es sich um einen Astigmatismus mixtus. Findet sich neben dem Astigmatismus noch eine Weit- oder Kurzsichtigkeit, nennt man diesen Zustand Astigmatismus compositus.

Daher wird es auch bezeichnet als: - Bannayan-Zonana-Syndrom - Riley-Smith-Syndrom - Ruvalcaba-Myhre-Syndrom - Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba-Syndrom (BRRS) - Bannayan-Syndrom - Cowden/Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba \u00fcberlappendes Syndrom - Makrozephalie, Pseudopapilledema und Multiple Hemangiomata Das Syndrom ist nicht zu verwechseln mit dem Myhre-Syndrom. Das Ruvalcaba-Myhre-Smith-Syndrom geh\u00f6rt zur Gruppe der heredit\u00e4ren Hamartoma-Polyposis-Syndrome. Bei allen Syndromen liegt eine Ver\u00e4nderung des Erbgut des PTEN-Gens mit zum Teil \u00fcberlappenden Symptomen vor. Daher werden diese Syndrome nicht mehr strikt getrennt. Zu den heredit\u00e4ren Harmatoma-Polyposis-Syndromen geh\u00f6ren weiter - Juveniles Polyposis-Syndrom - Peutz-Jeghers-Syndrom - Cowden-Syndrom Das Ruvalcaba-Myhre-Smith-Syndrom folgt einem autosomal-dominanten Erbgang. Die Vererbung erfolgt \u00fcber ein Nichtgeschlechtschromosom, ein Autosom. Da die autosomal-dominante Vererbung nicht geschlechtsspezifisch erfolgt, sind M\u00e4nner und Frauen in gleichem Ma\u00dfe betroffen. Im Gegensatz zur autosomal-rezessiven Vererbung sind M\u00e4nner und Frauen auch dann krank, wenn sie heterozygot erkrankt sind. Das bedeutet, dass nur eins der Allele des erkrankten Gens, das vom Vater oder das von der Mutter, defekt ist. Ein betroffener Elternteil tr\u00e4gt also eine ung\u00fcnstige Erbanlage, die mit 50 % Wahrscheinlichkeit an Nachkommen weitergegeben werden kann. Das Ruvalcaba-Myhre-Smith-Syndrom kann durch eine Mutationsanalyse des PTEN-Gens mittels einer direkten DNA-Sequenzierung nachgewiesen werden. Als Ausgangsmaterial wird eine Blut-DNA-Probe der zu untersuchenden Person ben\u00f6tigt. Wenn der famili\u00e4re Erbgang mitbestimmt werden soll, wird auch den Kindern oder Eltern Blut entnommen. Charakteristische Kennzeichen f\u00fcr das Ruvalcaba-Myhre-Smith-Syndrom sind - ein Geburtsgewicht von 4 kg und mehr (mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit) - eine Geburtsgr\u00f6\u00dfe von 53 cm bei M\u00e4dchen (mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit) - eine Geburtsgr\u00f6\u00dfe von 55 cm bei Jungen (mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit) - sp\u00e4tes Laufenlernen - eine allgemeine Entwicklungsst\u00f6rung/ -verz\u00f6gerung - eine au\u00dferordentliche Kopfgr\u00f6\u00dfe/ Makrozephalie (bei 50 % der Betroffenen) - H\u00e4mangiome, gutartige Neubildung der Blutgef\u00e4\u00dfe (bei 10 bis 40) - multiple Lipome, gutartige Fettgewebsneubildungen (bei 75 %) - Pigmentflecken auf dem Penis (mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit) - gest\u00f6rte Motorik (Ungelenkigkeit) (bei 50 %) - Muskelschw\u00e4che (bei 50 %) - Skoliose (bei 50 %) Die Auspr\u00e4gung der Merkmale ist bei den Betroffenen jedoch sehr unterschiedlich. Vom Ruvalcaba-Myhre-Smith-Syndrom betroffene M\u00e4nner und Frauen haben ein erh\u00f6htes Risiko, an Schilddr\u00fcsenkrebs oder Darmkrebs zu erkranken, Frauen zudem an Brustkrebs. Daher sollen sowohl M\u00e4nner als auch Frauen bereits ab etwa 21 Jahren regelm\u00e4\u00dfige Vorsorgeuntersuchungen vornehmen lassen."}

Das Vollbild der Erkrankung manifestiert sich meistens ab dem 30. Lebensjahr. Die Patienten erscheinen bereits in fr\u00fchem Erwachsenenalter alt, sie weisen eine d\u00fcnne, durchscheinende Haut (Dystrophie) auf, die mit zunehmendem Alter verkalkt; es kommt zum Verlust von Unterhautfettgewebe und Pigmentierung.

Durch die Lungenreife-Induktion vor der Geburt konnte die Inzidenz des Atemnotsyndroms gesenkt werden. Bei Fr\u00fchgeborenen vor der 28. Schwangerschaftswoche ist das Atemnotsyndrom aber immer noch die wichtigste Todesursache. Bei Fr\u00fchgeburten ist meist die Nebennierenrinde noch nicht v\u00f6llig entwickelt (geschieht erst in der 35. Schwangerschaftswoche). Deshalb ist der F\u00f6tus noch nicht f\u00e4hig, dort Cortisol zu produzieren, was aber zwingend n\u00f6tig ist f\u00fcr die Entwicklung der Pneumozyten Typ II, da diese Surfactant bilden. Surfactant ist eine von der Lunge produzierte grenzfl\u00e4chenaktive Substanz, welche die Oberfl\u00e4chenspannung des Fl\u00fcssigkeitsfilms, der den Lungenbl\u00e4schen (Alveolen) aufliegt, herabsetzt und damit den Druck vermindert, der zu deren Entfaltung erforderlich ist (\u2192 Lungenreifung). Bei Surfactantmangel kollabieren die Alveolen bereits bei normalen intrathorakalen Dr\u00fccken, es m\u00fcssen hohe Beatmungsdr\u00fccke aufgewandt werden, um die Entfaltung (und damit die Lungenbel\u00fcftung) sicherzustellen (s. a. Abschnitt Therapie). Hohe Beatmungsdr\u00fccke k\u00f6nnen (weitere) Lungensch\u00e4den hervorrufen. Surfactantmangel f\u00fchrt in der Lunge zur Ausbildung hyaliner Membranen (Mukopolysaccharide und Glykoproteine aus dem Blutplasma), die Lungen verhalten sich wenig elastisch bis steif. Viele Autoren wie Mayatepek oder Muntau definieren den Begriff ANS relativ eng als: - prim\u00e4re Surfactant-Bildungsst\u00f6rung des Fr\u00fchgeborenen.

Nosema apis, erstmals 1909 von Enoch Zander beschrieben, ist ein einzelliger Parasit aus der Abteilung der Mikrosporidien (Microsporidia), das sind Kleinsporentierchen, die meist zu den Pilzen gerechnet werden. Das Ruhestadium von Nosema apis ist eine langlebige Spore, die in sauberem, 4 \u00b0C kaltem Wasser bis zu sieben und im Bienenkot rund zwei Jahre \u00fcberdauern kann, w\u00e4hrend sie in bakterienhaltigem Wasser, toten Bienen oder bei Austrocknung schneller abstirbt. Bei Temperaturen von 33 \u00b0C sind die Sporen etwa 21 Tage lebensf\u00e4hig. 1996 wurde in Asien ein \u00e4hnliches Mikrosporidium als Parasit der \u00f6stlichen Honigbiene (Apis cerana) entdeckt, das folgerichtig als Nosema ceranae bezeichnet wird. \u00dcber die Symptome und den Krankheitsverlauf bei der asiatischen Honigbiene ist bis heute jedoch nur wenig bekannt. Chinesische Forscher (Huang u. a. 2005) fanden Nosema ceranae im Fr\u00fchjahr 2005 auf Taiwan erstmals auch auf der westlichen Honigbiene (Apis mellifera). Kurz darauf berichteten spanische Bienenwissenschaftler (Higes u. a. ), dass der neue Erreger 2005 auch in Spanien entdeckt worden ist und nach ihren Erkenntnissen eine deutlich h\u00f6here Virulenz als die westliche Variante besitzt. Die durch Nosema ceranae verursachte Nosemose bei westlichen Honigbienen in Spanien ist mit einem vom bisher typischen Befund abweichenden, schwereren Erkrankungsbild verbunden (ungew\u00f6hnlich schwere Darmsch\u00e4digungen bei den Bienen, kein Durchfall, bevorzugter Befall \u00e4lterer Sammelbienen, die fernab der Behausungen sterben, und dadurch bedingtes \u201eLeerfliegen\u201c und Kollabieren der Bienenv\u00f6lker). Beobachtet wurde ferner eine binnen weniger Jahre sehr stark vermehrte Ausbreitung der Nosemose und ihr Auftreten zu bisher ungew\u00f6hnlichen Jahreszeiten (ganzj\u00e4hrig), was offenbar auf die h\u00f6here Widerstandsf\u00e4higkeit von Nosema ceranae zur\u00fcckzuf\u00fchren ist. Vermutet wird daher auch eine h\u00f6here Reinfektionsrate der Bienenv\u00f6lker, da der Erreger in der Au\u00dfenumwelt l\u00e4nger \u00fcberlebt. Beide Erregertypen lassen sich mit den bisher \u00fcblichen Routineuntersuchungen nicht unterscheiden, sondern nur mithilfe molekulargenetischer Methoden (PCR) auseinanderhalten. Als besorgniserregend sehen die Forscher den Umstand an, dass sich Nosema ceranae in Spanien offenbar gegen Nosema apis durchgesetzt hat (es wurden fast nur noch \u00f6stliche Exemplare gefunden). Sie bringen das Auftauchen dieses Erregers daher mit dem in Spanien seit Herbst 2004 beobachteten massiven Bienensterben in Zusammenhang. Sie vermuten, dass sich auch in anderen europ\u00e4ischen L\u00e4ndern ein \u00e4hnlicher Befund stellen lie\u00dfe, da auch aus Frankreich (seit Ende der 90er Jahre) und Deutschland (2002/2003) von vermehrten und bislang nicht schl\u00fcssig aufgekl\u00e4rten V\u00f6lkerverlusten berichtet wird.

In: Journal of the American College of Cardiology. 33, 1999, S. 1662\u20131666,. Die Trikuspidalklappe funktioniert wie ein Ventil zwischen dem rechten Vorhof und dem rechten Ventrikel des Herzens. Sie \u00f6ffnet sich in der F\u00fcllungsphase des Ventrikels (Diastole) und erm\u00f6glicht so den Einstrom von Blut aus dem Vorhof. Zu Beginn der Auswurfphase (Systole) f\u00fchrt der pl\u00f6tzlich ansteigende Druck im Ventrikel zum Schluss der Klappe und damit zur \u201eAbdichtung\u201c des Vorhofs. Auf diese Weise herrscht im Vorhof nur ein Druck von etwa 4 mmHg, w\u00e4hrend gleichzeitig im Ventrikel der systolische Druck von etwa 25 mmHg das Blut auf seinem \u00fcblichen Weg in die Lungenschlagader (Pulmonalarterie) treibt. Bei einer leichten Trikuspidalinsuffizienz sind diese physiologischen Vorg\u00e4nge nur geringf\u00fcgig ver\u00e4ndert. Weder die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe der Undichtigkeit (Regurgitations\u00f6ffnung) noch die Menge zur\u00fcckstr\u00f6menden Blutes (Regurgitationsvolumen, Pendelvolumen, R\u00fcckstromvolumen) erreichen bedeutsame Ausma\u00dfe, so dass die Dr\u00fccke im rechten Vorhof und in den Hohlvenen ebenso normal bleiben wie die F\u00f6rderleistung des Herzens. Bei der schweren Trikuspidalinsuffizienz hingegen betragen die Regurgitations\u00f6ffnung mehr als 40 mm\u00b2 und das Regurgitationsvolumen mehr als 60 ml, was zu schwerwiegenden und zum Teil lebensbedrohlichen Ver\u00e4nderungen f\u00fchren kann. Im akuten Stadium, bei normaler Gr\u00f6\u00dfe von rechtem Ventrikel und rechten Vorhof, kommt es zu einem erheblichen Anstieg des Drucks im Vorhof und damit auch in den Hohlvenen. Dieser kann bis zu 50 mmHg betragen, was bei einer normalen Beschaffenheit der Hohlvenen zum sofortigen Leberstau und zum ven\u00f6sen Stau in die Halsvenen f\u00fchrt. Dar\u00fcber hinaus kann der dann \u00fcberwiegende Blutr\u00fcckstrom eine mangelhafte Auswurfleistung in die Lungenschlagader und damit eine Mangeldurchblutung aller Organe nach sich ziehen. Ist das Akutstadium \u00fcberstanden oder entwickelt sich die Trikuspidalklappeninsuffizienz \u00fcber einen l\u00e4ngeren Zeitraum, so kommt es chronisch zu einer Reihe von Anpassungsvorg\u00e4ngen (Kompensationsmechanismen) am Herzen und an den vorgeschalteten Venen. Zun\u00e4chst f\u00fchrt die anhaltende Druck- und Volumenbelastung des Vorhofes zu dessen Vergr\u00f6\u00dferung (Dilatation, Dilatatio cordis), wobei das Vorhofvolumen innerhalb von Monaten und Jahren oft auf das Drei- bis Vierfache zunehmen kann."}

Untersuchungen bei aktuellen Behandlungsregimes zeigen jedoch ein deutlich selteneres Auftreten, so wird in der Erstlinientherapie eine j\u00e4hrliche Inzidenz von nur 5-10 % ausgewiesen, die in den Folgejahren weniger fortzuschreiten scheint. Die Lipodystrophie geht einher mit einer Erh\u00f6hung der Blutfette und des Serumcholesterins sowie einer Umverteilung des Fettgewebes, wobei sowohl atrophische als auch hypertrophische Ver\u00e4nderungen auftreten k\u00f6nnen.

Es handelt sich in den meisten F\u00e4llen um ein autosomal-dominant vererbtes Leiden, daher gibt es H\u00e4ufungen innerhalb einzelner Familien. In den meisten F\u00e4llen wird die CMT durch eine Mutation auf dem Chromosom 17 hervorgerufen. CMT ist eine vererbliche Erkrankung der peripheren Nerven, bei der durch eine genetische Mutation entweder der Nervenzellfortsatz, Axon genannt, oder die isolierende Myelinschicht gesch\u00e4digt wird. Das Myelin k\u00f6nnte mit der Kunststoffisolierung um ein Elektrokabel verglichen werden. Es wird die saltatorische Erregungsleitung, also die Fortleitung von Nervenimpulsen in peripheren Nerven behindert, sodass die Befehle des Gehirns die Muskeln nicht richtig erreichen k\u00f6nnen. Aus der Denervierung folgt eine Schw\u00e4che und ein Abbau der betroffenen Muskulatur. Anders als bei den Muskeldystrophien werden die Menschen, die CMT haben, mit normalen Muskeln geboren. Die Muskeln schwinden (atrophieren), weil die von CMT beeintr\u00e4chtigten Nerven die Befehle des Gehirns f\u00fcr bestimmte Muskelbewegungen nicht exakt \u00fcbertragen k\u00f6nnen. Der prim\u00e4re Defekt besteht in einer Verdopplung des PMP (Peripheral Myelin Protein) Gens auf Chromosom 17. Dies f\u00fchrt zun\u00e4chst zur Verdickung der Myelinscheiden. Auf die Dauer wird die Myelinscheide und/oder das Axon gesch\u00e4digt, vermutlich durch die Behinderung der Versorgung mit N\u00e4hrstoffen. Je st\u00e4rker die Myelinschicht gesch\u00e4digt ist, desto geringer ist die Nervenleitgeschwindigkeit und desto schwerwiegender die Auspr\u00e4gung des Krankheitsbildes. Normal ist eine Nervenleitgeschwindigkeit von 50 m/s. Bei der demyelinisierenden Form liegt eine Leitgeschwindigkeit von 38 m/s vor. Die Erkrankung setzt oft schon im Kindesalter ein.

Dadurch kommt es zu einer Dysregulation von BCL2 und das Gen wird dauerhaft aktiviert. Da BCL2 normalerweise eine wichtige Rolle bei der Apoptose von B-Zellen spielt, ist diese gest\u00f6rt und die betroffenen Zellen vermehren sich weiter ungehemmt und werden so zu Tumorzellen.

Anatomisch vereinfacht stellt er sich somit wie ein gr\u00f6\u00dferer Gegenstand dar, der auf eine Schnur aufgezogen ist und beweglich pendeln kann. Bei der Magendrehung, meist im Uhrzeigersinn um die L\u00e4ngsachse, kommt es zu einem Verschluss (Obstruktion) des Mageneingangs, so dass im Magen befindliche Luft nicht mehr durch \u201eAufsto\u00dfen\u201c entweichen kann. Die Luft im Magen wird bei hastigem Fressen und/oder bei der Drehung im Angstzustand abgeschluckt. Die Annahme, es seien G\u00e4rungsgase, ist mittlerweile widerlegt. Ob die Aufgasung des Magens f\u00fcr die Drehung verantwortlich oder seine Folge ist, ist bislang ungekl\u00e4rt. Mit zunehmender Aufgasung komprimiert der Magen sowohl Blutgef\u00e4\u00dfe (vor allem die Pfortader und die hintere Hohlvene) als auch Nervenstr\u00e4nge und das Zwerchfell. Diese zunehmende Minderversorgung mit Blut f\u00fchrt zu einem raschen Sauerstoffmangel aller Organe und zu einer \u00dcbers\u00e4uerung des Blutes und m\u00fcndet innerhalb von Stunden in einen meist t\u00f6dlichen Kreislaufschock. Nur in wenigen F\u00e4llen wurde eine spontane R\u00fcckdrehung des Magens beobachtet. Die eigentliche Ursache der Magendrehung ist nicht bekannt, nur eine Reihe von Risikofaktoren. Am h\u00e4ufigsten sind gro\u00dfe Hunderassen mit tiefem Brustkorb betroffen. Unter ihnen haben einige Rassen ein besonders hohes Erkrankungsrisiko. So betr\u00e4gt das Risiko eines Tieres, im Laufe des Lebens eine Magendrehung zu erleiden, bei Deutschen Doggen und Bloodhounds 30 %, bei gro\u00dfen Windhundrassen und Collies 20 % und beim Irischen Wolfshund 18 %. Mit zunehmendem Alter und gedehnten Magenb\u00e4ndern steigt das Risiko der Erkrankung ebenfalls. Sehr selten tritt eine Magendrehung auch bei kleinen Hunden, Katzen und Meerschweinchen auf (\u2192 Magendrehung bei der Katze und Magendrehung beim Meerschweinchen). Alle \u00fcbrigen mutma\u00dflichen Risikofaktoren lassen sich nicht eindeutig belegen. Eine einmalige F\u00fctterung pro Tag soll das Erkrankungsrisiko erh\u00f6hen, die Verteilung der t\u00e4glichen Futterration auf mehrere Portionen kann die Erkrankung aber nicht verhindern. Vermehrtes Luftschlucken durch hastige Futteraufnahme ist als Risikofaktor nicht sicher best\u00e4tigt. Im Gegensatz zu fr\u00fcheren Empfehlungen besagen neuere Studien, dass eine erh\u00f6hte Position der Futtersch\u00fcssel zu einem gesteigerten Risiko f\u00fchre.

Histologisch handelt es sich um gliale Tumoren mit ependymaler Differenzierung, das hei\u00dft, die Tumorzellen neigen wie die Ependymzellen dazu, Oberfl\u00e4chen zu bilden. Diagnostisch sind sogenannte ependymale Rosetten, in denen mehrere Tumorzellen ein zentrales Lumen bilden.

Das Risiko, ein Kind mit Trisomie 18 zu geb\u00e4ren, ist stark vom Alter der Mutter abh\u00e4ngig. So betr\u00e4gt f\u00fcr eine achtzehnj\u00e4hrige Frau das Risiko, in der 12. Schwangerschaftswoche ein Kind mit einer Trisomie 18 im Mutterleib zu tragen, etwa 1:2500. Dieses Risiko steigt auf etwa 1:180 bei einer vierzigj\u00e4hrigen Frau an. Da zwischen der 12.

Unterschieden werden folgende Typen: Bei den meisten Menschen mit Edwards-Syndrom (ca. 95 %) besitzen alle K\u00f6rperzellen das komplette Chromosom 18 dreifach. Diese Form des Syndroms entsteht, wenn eine der Keimzellen ein zus\u00e4tzliches Chromosom 18 enth\u00e4lt.

Bei Typ V liegt eine Mutation im CaSR (extrazellul\u00e4rer Calcium-Ion-Sensing-Rezeptor) vor, der die NKCC2 und den ROMK inhibiert. Das Hyperprostaglandin-E-Syndrom ist eine Kombination aus den Typen I, II und III. Die Krankheit ist mit einer Auftrittswahrscheinlichkeit (Pr\u00e4valenz) von 1 bis 9 : 1. 000. 000 sehr selten. Der Erbgang der Typen I bis IV ist autosomal-rezessiv. Typ V wird dagegen autosomal-dominant vererbt. Bisher wurden f\u00fcnf verschiedene Gene gefunden, die bei der Entstehung des Bartter-Syndrom involviert sind: Der Blutdruck ist typischerweise trotz erh\u00f6htem Renin und Aldosteron erniedrigt. Bei erniedrigten Kaliumwerten kommt es zur metabolischen Alkalose und zum Salzverlust. Dehydratation, Erbrechen und Polyurie sind m\u00f6glich. Als Folge des Hyperaldosteronismus entstehen eine Hypokali\u00e4mie sowie eine metabolische Alkalose. Weitere Symptome sind: - Verlangen nach Kochsalz - Muskelkr\u00e4mpfe - Muskelhypotonie (Muskelschw\u00e4che) bis zur Bewegungsunf\u00e4higkeit - Zittern, Taubheitsgef\u00fchle in den Fingern/Zehen, brennende F\u00fc\u00dfe - Migr\u00e4neartige Kopfschmerzen, Verwirrtheit, Erinnerungsst\u00f6rungen, Schwindelgef\u00fchl - Gelenkschmerzen, Magenkr\u00e4mpfe Es wird versucht, durch Infusionen den Kaliumspiegel und den Natriumspiegel zu heben.

Diese Thromben bestehen aus gro\u00dfen vWF-Multimeren und aktivierten Blutpl\u00e4ttchen. Durch die Gef\u00e4\u00dfverschl\u00fcsse kommt es zur Isch\u00e4mie der nachgeschalteten Gewebe. Ebenso werden die Erythrozyten durch die Gef\u00e4\u00dfverschl\u00fcsse mechanisch gesch\u00e4digt. und zerfallen im Sinn einer H\u00e4molyse. Man unterscheidet die erbliche Form und die erworbene Form der TTP. Die erbliche TTP kommt durch eine Mutation des f\u00fcr das ADAMTS-13 codierende Gen zustande. Es sind rund einhundert homozygote und compound-heterozygote Mutationen beschrieben welche die Aktivit\u00e4t der Metalloprotease reduzieren. Dabei korreliert die Auspr\u00e4gung der Erkrankung mit der Restaktivit\u00e4t des Enzyms. Patienten mit einer Restaktivit\u00e4t von unter 10 % entwickeln eine TTP.

Zudem kommt es in 20 % der F\u00e4lle zu einer Leberbeteiligung und damit einer Erh\u00f6hung der Leberwerte (Transaminasen, alkalische Phosphatasen und Bilirubin), welche laborchemisch nachgewiesen werden kann. Ein Bluthochdruck in der Schwangerschaft (hypertensive Schwangerschaftserkrankung) entwickelt sich in etwa 5 bis 7 Prozent aller Schwangerschaften in Westeuropa. In 70 % dieser F\u00e4lle besteht eine Pr\u00e4eklampsie, in 30 % ein vorher schon bestandener, nicht diagnostizierter Bluthochdruck. H\u00e4ufiger betroffen sind Erstgeb\u00e4rende und Frauen \u00fcber 35 Jahre. Weitere Risikofaktoren sind das Auftreten von Pr\u00e4eklampsie in einer vorangegangenen Schwangerschaft, Mehrlingsschwangerschaften, vorbestehender Bluthochdruck, Fettleibigkeit und Diabetes mellitus. Mehrere Studien geben Hinweise, dass eine Parodontitis das Risiko einer schweren Pr\u00e4eklampsie erh\u00f6hen kann. Autoimmunerkrankungen erh\u00f6hen erheblich das Risiko f\u00fcr eine Pr\u00e4eklampsie; hervorzuheben ist hier das Antiphospholipid-Syndrom (APS), welches als schwerwiegendster aller Risikofaktoren das Auftreten einer Pr\u00e4eklampsie oder Eklampsie um das Neunfache beg\u00fcnstigt. Die Ursachen f\u00fcr eine Pr\u00e4eklampsie sind zurzeit nicht eindeutig gekl\u00e4rt.

Auch St\u00f6rungen im Prostaglandinstoffwechsel scheinen eine Rolle zu spielen. Ein bakterieller oder viraler Ursprung ist hingegen unwahrscheinlich. Eine Studie der Universit\u00e4t von Pittsburgh zeigt, dass ein Vitamin-D-Mangel in der Fr\u00fchschwangerschaft das Entstehen der Krankheit beg\u00fcnstigt. Eine Reihe neuerer Untersuchungen lassen indes eine zentrale Beteiligung von Blutdruck-regulierenden (endothelialen) Substanzen als am wahrscheinlichsten erscheinen. In einer Studie an M\u00e4usen konnten Pr\u00e4eklampsie-Symptome durch Herbeif\u00fchren eines Mangels an Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) simuliert werden.

Etwa 6 % aller Krebserkrankungen beim Mann und circa 3 % bei der Frau sind Leberzellkarzinome. Dabei zeigen sich allerdings ausgepr\u00e4gte geografische Unterschiede: In allen L\u00e4ndern, in denen die Hepatitis B sehr h\u00e4ufig auftritt, ist auch das hepatozellul\u00e4re Karzinom h\u00e4ufig zu finden. Das trifft insbesondere f\u00fcr Asien und Afrika zu. In Europa ist das Karzinom hingegen eher selten, und es entwickelt sich meist auf dem Boden einer Leberzirrhose. Allerdings nimmt die Inzidenz auch in den westlichen L\u00e4ndern in den letzten Jahren kontinuierlich zu. Ursachen hierf\u00fcr sind die Zunahme an Virus-verursachten chronischen Hepatitiden (Leberentz\u00fcndungen), der anhaltend hohe Alkoholkonsum und die hohe Zahl an Personen mit krankhafter Leberverfettung (\u201eFettleber\u201c). Ende 2007 wurde eine wesentliche molekulare Ursache f\u00fcr die Entstehung von Leberkrebs gefunden. Zellbiologische Untersuchungen, ver\u00f6ffentlicht in der Fachzeitschrift Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, zeigen, dass bei ca. 60 % der Tumorpatienten das Tumorsuppressorgen FHIT gest\u00f6rt ist. Das Gen FHIT (engl. fragile histidine triad) im Chromosom 3 enth\u00e4lt die Erbinformation f\u00fcr ein gleichnamiges Protein, das wiederum Catenin, ein f\u00fcr den Zellaufbau zentrales Molek\u00fcl steuert. Die Ver\u00e4nderung des Gens hemmt die Herstellung einer Vielzahl von Proteinen, was zu einem unkontrollierten Zellwachstum f\u00fchren kann. Im Labor ist es den Forschern gelungen, durch Einbringen eines gesunden FHIT-Gens in Krebszellen die Produktion dieser Proteine zu hemmen und das f\u00fcr Tumorzellen typische unkontrollierte Wachstum zu verringern. Risikofaktoren f\u00fcr das HCC sind: - Leberzirrhose: Bei bestehender Leberzirrhose ist grunds\u00e4tzlich das Erkrankungsrisiko f\u00fcr das hepatozellul\u00e4re Karzinom erh\u00f6ht.

Das gr\u00f6\u00dfte Risiko besteht bei einer Leberzirrhose auf der Grundlage einer Hepatitis. Bei einer konnatalen Infektion mit HBV oder HCV ist das Risiko nochmals erh\u00f6ht. - nichtalkoholische Fettleberhepatitis (NASH): diese Patienten haben auch ohne Zirrhose ein erh\u00f6htes Risiko, ein HCC zu entwickeln."}

Aufgrund der schr\u00e4gen Lage der Epiphysenfuge zur Gewichtsbelastung durch den Rumpfbereich kommt es entsprechend zur typischen Verschiebung; die Epiphyse gleitet nach unten (Varusfehlstellung) und hinten (Retrotorsion).

Die Bauchspeicheldr\u00fcse erzeugt in den \u03b2-Zellen der Langerhansschen Inseln das Hormon Insulin. Als Botenstoff bewirkt Insulin den Transport von Glukose ins Zellinnere, wo die Glukose anschlie\u00dfend zur Energiegewinnung verbraucht wird (Glykolyse). Dar\u00fcber hinaus bewirkt Insulin auch eine Speicherung von Glukose in Form von Glykogen in der Leber sowie in den Muskelzellen, wodurch der Blutzuckerspiegel nach der Nahrungsaufnahme in engen Grenzen (ca. 80\u2013120 mg/dl oder 4,5\u20136,7 mmol/l) konstant gehalten wird. Selbst bei langer N\u00fcchternheit bleibt der Blutzuckerspiegel dabei auf normalem Niveau, wof\u00fcr dann wiederum vor allem die Leber sorgt, zum einen dadurch, dass das zuvor gebildete Glykogen wieder zur\u00fcck in Glukose aufgespalten und zur\u00fcck ins Blut abgegeben wird, zum anderen dadurch, dass die Leber biochemisch st\u00e4ndig neue Glukose produziert (Gluconeogenese). Wenn die insulinproduzierenden \u03b2-Zellen nicht mehr genug oder gar kein Insulin mehr produzieren oder z. B. aufgrund von Entz\u00fcndungen oder Operationen gar nicht mehr vorhanden sind, fehlen also sowohl die Glukose-Aufnahme in die K\u00f6rperzellen als auch die Hemmung der Glukose-Neubildung in der Leber (die t\u00e4glich bis zu 500 Gramm Glukose neu produzieren kann). Diese Neubildung erkl\u00e4rt das Ansteigen des Blutzuckerspiegels bei Diabetikern z. B. am fr\u00fchen Morgen im n\u00fcchternen Zustand (siehe auch Dawn-Ph\u00e4nomen). Beim Diabetes mellitus verbleibt die aufgenommene Glukose im Blut, oder die k\u00f6rpereigene Glukose-Neubildung in der Leber verl\u00e4uft ungebremst weiter und liefert best\u00e4ndig Glukose nach, was den kontinuierlichen Verbrauch ausgleicht oder sogar \u00fcbersteigt und im Ergebnis den Blutzucker ansteigen l\u00e4sst. Es ist ein sehr komplexer und dynamischer biochemischer Prozess, bei dem Zufl\u00fcsse, Abfl\u00fcsse, Neubildung und Abbau von Glukose st\u00e4ndig zu bilanzieren, das hei\u00dft zu verrechnen sind. Um diese Zusammenh\u00e4nge \u2013 und damit die Krankheit und den Umgang mit der Krankheit \u2013 zu verstehen, m\u00fcssen betroffene Patienten sorgf\u00e4ltig informiert und beraten und gegebenenfalls geschult werden, zum Beispiel bei der Erstellung geeigneter Ern\u00e4hrungspl\u00e4ne. Dar\u00fcber hinaus hat Insulin noch eine weitere, dritte Wirkung. Es ist das einzige Hormon des menschlichen K\u00f6rpers, das K\u00f6rperfett aufbaut und auch daf\u00fcr sorgt, dass dieses Fett in den Depots bleibt (sogenannte adipogene Wirkung). Ein wesentliches Kennzeichen des schweren, anhaltenden Insulinmangels ist daher auch eine extreme Gewichtsabnahme durch Wegfall der adipogenen Wirkung, insbesondere durch Abbau von K\u00f6rperfett und (Muskel-)Eiwei\u00df zur Energiegewinnung. 1965 ver\u00f6ffentlichte die Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) in ihren \u201eEmpfehlungen zur Klassifikation und Diagnostik\u201c eine Unterscheidung verschiedener Diabetestypen. 1997 \u00e4nderte die amerikanische Diabetes-Gesellschaft (ADA) die Kriterien f\u00fcr Klassifizierung und Diagnose, die 1998 von der WHO und 2000 von der Deutschen Diabetes Gesellschaft (DDG) \u00fcbernommen wurden."}

In mindestens zehn der F\u00e4lle (vorwiegend bei Jungen) sind Fehlbildungen der Netzhaut im Auge (Retina-Kolobom) nachweisbar. Das Joubert-Syndrom wird charakterisiert durch das Fehlen oder eine weitgehende Unterentwicklung der Struktur zwischen den beiden Teilen des Kleinhirns, des Vermis cerebelli (lat. : Vermis = Wurm, Cerebellum = Kleinhirn), der sie \u00fcblicherweise verbindet. Auch angrenzende Teile der Kleinhirnregionen sind stark unterentwickelt oder fehlen. Bei einem Teil der Menschen mit Joubert-Syndrom bestehen Besonderheiten der Regenbogenhaut (Iris), Fehlbildungen der Netzhaut (Retina), der Zellschicht zwischen den Sehzellen und der darunter liegenden Aderhaut (retinales Pigmentepithel / RPE) sowie der Aderhaut (Chorioidea) selbst. \u00dcber die Lebenserwartung von Kindern mit Joubert-Sydrom ist sich die Fachwelt nach wie vor nicht einig. Viele Kinder \u00fcberleben das Kinderalter nicht, andere Kinder haben eine gute Entwicklungsprognose. Es sind inzwischen symptomatische Therapie- oder Behandlungsm\u00f6glichkeiten bekannt (Beatmung, kontinuierliche Monitor\u00fcberwachung (insbesondere SpO2), Intensivbetreuung, O2-Substitution bei Apnoe / zyanotischen Zust\u00e4nden, Krankengymnastik, Fr\u00fchf\u00f6rderung, \u00dcberwachung von Kopfumfang / Leber- / Nierenwerten, Sehhilfenversorgung). Das Syndrom ist jedoch nicht urs\u00e4chlich heilbar. Beide Geschlechter sind gleicherma\u00dfen h\u00e4ufig betroffen. Das Joubert-Syndrom folgt einem autosomal-rezessiven Erbgang, das hei\u00dft ein Kind kann die Besonderheit nur dann bekommen, wenn seine beiden biologischen Elternteile Tr\u00e4ger einer bestimmten genetischen Besonderheit sind und diese an das Kind vererben. Da F\u00e4lle von Joubert-Syndrom mit und ohne Fehlbildungen der Augen an Regenbogenhaut, Netzhaut und Aderhaut bisher noch nicht gemeinsam in einer Geschwisterschaft beobachtet wurden, werden f\u00fcr beide Formen unterschiedliche genetische Besonderheiten angenommen.

M\u00e4rz 2003 erh\u00e4rtete sich jedoch der Verdacht, dass der Erreger zur Familie Coronaviridae geh\u00f6rt. Er wurde gleichzeitig an der Universit\u00e4t Hongkong, an den Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta und am Bernhard-Nocht-Institut f\u00fcr Tropenmedizin in Hamburg als neues Coronavirus identifiziert. Anhand der Gensequenzen wird vermutet, dass ein bekanntes Coronavirus entweder mutiert oder dass eine Virusart, die bisher nur Tiere befallen hat, auf den Menschen \u201e\u00fcbergesprungen\u201c ist. Weitere Untersuchungen konzentrierten sich daher auf das neu entdeckte Coronavirus und als weitere Faktoren auf Chlamydien und Paramyxoviren. Bisher sei nichts gefunden worden, \u201ewas gegen die urs\u00e4chliche Rolle des Coronavirus spricht\u201c, hei\u00dft es aus Fachkreisen. Am 12. April 2003 gab Marco Marra, Direktor des Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre der British Columbia Cancer Agency, bekannt, es sei ihm gemeinsam mit anderen kanadischen Forschern gelungen, die RNA-Sequenz des Virus zu entschl\u00fcsseln. Vier Tage darauf ver\u00f6ffentlichte die WHO eine Pressemitteilung mit der Erkl\u00e4rung, das von mehreren Laboratorien identifizierte Coronavirus sei der offizielle Ausl\u00f6ser von SARS. Es erhielt die Bezeichnung SARS-assoziiertes Coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Zwei Tage nach Identifizierung des Virus gelang es den Virologen Christian Drosten und Stephan G\u00fcnther vom Bernhard-Nocht-Institut als ersten, einen diagnostischen Test zu entwickeln, der inzwischen weltweit eingesetzt wird. Einige Experten glaubten zun\u00e4chst, das Virus hinter der asiatischen Lungenkrankheit k\u00f6nnte von seltenen wilden Tieren als Hauptwirt (Reservoirwirt) (z. B. den Larvenrollern aus der Familie der Schleichkatzen) stammen, die in S\u00fcdchina gerne als Delikatesse verzehrt werden. Letzteres wird durch Berichte in der chinesischen Tageszeitung Lianhe Wanbao unterst\u00fctzt, wonach die Krankheit vom Koch eines Spezialit\u00e4tenrestaurants f\u00fcr wilde Tiere in Shenzhen in S\u00fcdchina ausgegangen sein k\u00f6nnte. Auch Virologen eines WHO-Teams halten diese Theorie f\u00fcr plausibel. F\u00fcr die mechanische \u00dcbertragung der Viren sind Kakerlaken als Vektor, Transportwirt festgestellt worden. Im September 2005 ergab eine Studie an verschiedenen wildlebenden Tieren im Hongkonger Gro\u00dfraum, dass das SARS-Coronavirus auch von Flederm\u00e4usen \u00fcbertragen wird. Bei den Tieren handelt es sich um Hufeisennasen (Rhinopholus sinicus)."}

Die wichtigste Aufgabe des Lysosoms ist der Abbau (\u201eVerdauung\u201c) von k\u00f6rperfremden, aber auch k\u00f6rpereigenen Substanzen. Bei diesen Substanzen handelt es sich um Makromolek\u00fcle wie Proteine, Polysaccharide, Nucleins\u00e4uren und Lipide. Der Abbau wird durch eine Reihe von Enzymen katalysiert. Bei den Enzymen handelt es sich um hydrolysierende (aufspaltende) Enzyme, sogenannte Hydrolasen wie beispielsweise Proteasen, Nukleasen und Lipasen. Ist die Aktivit\u00e4t eines dieser Enzyme deutlich herabgesetzt, das hei\u00dft, das Enzym kann den Abbau eines Makromolek\u00fcls nicht mehr oder nur erheblich langsamer katalysieren, so reichern sich die abzubauenden Makromolek\u00fcle zun\u00e4chst in der Zelle an. Ab einer bestimmten Konzentration k\u00f6nnen sie \u00fcber die Plasmamembran unkontrolliert in die extrazellul\u00e4re Matrix gelangen und sich so im gesamten Organismus anreichern. Die Ursache f\u00fcr eine verminderte Enzymaktivit\u00e4t kann ein Regulationsproblem oder ein Defekt im Genom des betroffenen Patienten sein. Im letzteren Fall kann das codierende Gen durch Mutation so ver\u00e4ndert sein, dass das Enzym in seiner Sekund\u00e4r- oder Terti\u00e4rstruktur ver\u00e4ndert ist und es weniger wirksam ist. Der genetische Defekt kann an die n\u00e4chste Generation weitergegeben werden. Je nach Erbgang bedeutet die Weitergabe des Gendefektes nicht automatisch eine Erkrankung der Nachkommen. Mukopolysaccharidose Typ II (Morbus Hunter) und Morbus Fabry werden X-chromosomal, alle anderen autosomal-rezessiv vererbt. Von der reduzierten Enzymaktivit\u00e4t sind meist die Organe Leber, Milz und Haut, aber auch das Nervensystem, Knorpel und Knochen betroffen. Neben der reduzierten Enzymaktivit\u00e4t k\u00f6nnen auch fehlende oder defekte Membrantransporter zu einer Anreicherung (Speicherung) von Stoffwechselprodukten in der Zelle f\u00fchren. Dies ist bei etwa f\u00fcnf der bisher bekannten lysosomalen Speicherkrankheiten der Fall. Der einzelne Defekt im Protein oder Membrantransporter kann zu einem sehr komplexen Krankheitsverlauf f\u00fchren. Generell werden die lysosomalen Speicherkrankheiten in drei Gruppen eingeteilt: schwere infantile, mittelschwere juvenile und milde adulte Formen. Die Gesamth\u00e4ufigkeit aller lysosomalen Speicherkrankheiten liegt bei etwa 1 auf 7500 bis 8000 Neugeburten. Es besteht die M\u00f6glichkeit, gentechnisch erzeugte Enzyme mittels Infusion den betroffenen Patienten zuzuf\u00fchren. Die Enzymersatztherapie (ERT) ist bei einigen Krankheiten wie beispielsweise Morbus Hunter (Idursulfase) oder Morbus Gaucher (Imiglucerase) mittlerweile ein etabliertes Verfahren."}

Es handelt sich um ein unbeh\u00fclltes Einzel(+)-Strang RNA-Virus von 32\u201334 nm Gr\u00f6\u00dfe. Fr\u00fcher als Teil der Familie Caliciviridae betrachtet, wird ihm inzwischen die monotypische Familie der Hepeviridae zugesprochen (Emerson u. a. , 2004). Mehrere humanpathogene Subtypen des HEV sind beschrieben worden. Die Erkrankung tritt meist in anikterischer Form auf und wurde erstmals 1980 in Indien entdeckt. Es sind insgesamt 5 HEV-Genotypen bekannt, wobei die Genotypen 1 bis 4 humanpathogen sind, w\u00e4hrend HEV-Genotyp 5 nur bei V\u00f6geln vorkommt. Die weltweite Verteilung dieser Genotypen ist unterschiedlich. In Europa wird \u00fcberwiegend der Genotyp 3 gefunden. F\u00fcr die verschiedenen HEV-Genotypen bestehen unterschiedliche Erregerreservoire. Die Genotypen 1 und 2 werden ganz \u00fcberwiegend nur von Mensch zu Mensch \u00fcbertragen. Typischerweise finden sich daher Infektionen mit diesen Genotypen in L\u00e4ndern mit schlechter Trinkwasserhygiene. In Mitteleuropa diagnostizierte HEV-Genotyp 1/2-F\u00e4lle sind \u00fcberwiegend aus s\u00fcdlichen L\u00e4ndern importierte Infektionen. Die HEV-Genotypen 3 und 4 konnten wiederholt bei Tieren nachgewiesen werden, insbesondere bei Hausschweinen und Wildschweinen sowie in Schweinefleisch. Die \u00dcbertragung auf den Menschen auf diesem Weg ist die vermutete Hauptinfektionsquelle in den Industrienationen. Damit kann die HEV Genotyp 3/4-Infektion als Zoonose bezeichnet werden. Das Robert Koch-Institut ermittelte f\u00fcr Deutschland eine HEV-Antik\u00f6rper-Pr\u00e4valenz von 16,8 %, d. h. 16,8 % der Untersuchten hatten Antik\u00f6rper gegen das Virus, was auf einen fr\u00fcheren Kontakt hindeutet."}

Die Amerikanische Faulbrut stellt keinerlei Gef\u00e4hrdung f\u00fcr die erwachsene (adulte) Biene, den Menschen oder andere Lebewesen dar. Die Bezeichnung \u201eamerikanisch\u201c bezieht sich nicht auf ein Ursprungsgebiet, sondern auf den Ort der Entdeckung; die Krankheit tritt weltweit auf. Ammenbienen f\u00fcttern Larven mit Sporen der Paenibacillus-larvae-Bakterien und stecken sie so an. An der TU Berlin und am L\u00e4nderinstitut f\u00fcr Bienenkunde in Hohen Neuendorf kl\u00e4rte man die Stoffwechselwege des Bakteriums auf. Nachdem eine Gensequenz auf einen ungew\u00f6hnlichen Sekund\u00e4rmetaboliten schlie\u00dfen lie\u00df, wurde dieser identifiziert und der Biosyntheseweg gekl\u00e4rt. Das Paenilamicin genannte Antibiotikum zerst\u00f6rt keine Bienenlarven. Seine antibakterielle Wirkung hilft dem Bakterium aber, sich gegen mikrobielle Konkurrenten im Larven-Darm durchzusetzen. In den D\u00e4rmen der Larven keimen die Sporen aus und vermehren sich als St\u00e4bchen (bacillus). Wird die Larve vor der Verdeckelung der Brutzelle von Bakterien get\u00f6tet, so wird sie von den ihrem Putztrieb folgenden Arbeiterinnen h\u00e4ufig entfernt. Wird die Brutzelle aber noch verdeckelt, so stirbt die Larve und zersetzt sich zu einer Faden ziehenden Masse (Streichholzprobe). Jede unerkannt gebliebene, infizierte Larve trocknet ein (Faulbrutschorf) und enth\u00e4lt nach vollst\u00e4ndiger Zersetzung bis zu 2,5 Milliarden neuer Sporen. Zusammenbrechende Bienenv\u00f6lker werden von Bienen anderer V\u00f6lker ausger\u00e4ubert, wodurch sich die Sporen in deren V\u00f6lker verteilen. Bei einem AFB-Ausbruch droht durch Verflug und R\u00e4uberei die Infizierung eines weiten Gebiets. Daher ist sie in Deutschland und einigen anderen L\u00e4ndern eine anzeigepflichtige Tierseuche. Nach der amtlichen Feststellung der Krankheit durch das zust\u00e4ndige Veterin\u00e4ramt wird ein Faulbrut-Sperrbezirk mit mindestens einem Kilometer Radius um den betroffenen Bienenstand eingerichtet. Eine Belastung seiner Bienenv\u00f6lker mit AFB-Sporen kann der Imker j\u00e4hrlich durch Futterkranzproben bestimmen lassen. Der Nachweis von Sporen in den Proben bedeutet aber nicht, dass die AFB auch schon ausgebrochen ist.

H\u00e4ufige Symptome bei Menschen mit CDC-Syndrom sind: - katzenschreiartige, hohe und schrille Laut\u00e4u\u00dferungen im fr\u00fchen Kindesalter, die sich mit der Zeit jedoch verlieren und auf eine Fehlbildung des Kehlkopfes (Laryngomalazie) zur\u00fcckgef\u00fchrt werden - Wachstumsst\u00f6rungen (Minderwuchs/unterdurchschnittliche K\u00f6rpergr\u00f6\u00dfe und unterdurchschnittliches K\u00f6rpergewicht) - Muskelschw\u00e4che (Muskelhypotonie) - ein vergleichsweise kleiner Kopf (Mikrozephalie), der oft l\u00e4nglich ist - rundes Gesicht - h\u00e4ufig recht tiefsitzende und besonders geformte (dysplastische) Ohren - ein schmales Kinn, Mikrognathie - eine verbreiterte und abgeflachte Nasenwurzel - vergleichsweise weit auseinanderliegende Augen (Hypertelorismus) - eine kleine, sichelf\u00f6rmige Hautfalte an den inneren Augenwinkeln (Epikanthus medialis) - nach au\u00dfen abfallende Lidachsen (die \u00e4u\u00dferen Lidwinkel liegen tiefer als die inneren) - Schwierigkeiten beim Saugen und Schlucken (daher oft Stillschwierigkeiten) - h\u00e4ufig chronische Verstopfung - h\u00e4ufige Infektionen der Ohren und der oberen Atemwege - selten Fehlbildungen der inneren Organe, wenn vorhanden, ist \u00fcberwiegend das Herz betroffen - Augenprobleme (z. B. optische Atrophie, Schielen/Strabismus, bei \u00e4lteren Menschen oft bilateral wechselnd) - Steigerung und Verbreiterung der Reflexe (= Hyperreflexie) - Verbiegung der Wirbels\u00e4ule (Skoliose), oft im fortgeschrittenen Lebensalter - kurze Mittelhand- und/oder Mittelfu\u00dfknochen - Plattf\u00fc\u00dfe - Zahnprobleme - Vierfingerfurche (nicht immer) - meist starke Verz\u00f6gerung der motorischen Entwicklung - meist starke Verz\u00f6gerung der lautsprachlichen Entwicklung - kognitive Behinderung mit individuell unterschiedlichem Schweregrad - mitunter Nierenagenesie Wenn keine ernsten medizinischen Probleme vorhanden sind bzw. auftreten, ist die Lebenserwartung von Menschen mit CDC-Syndrom offenbar nicht wesentlich verk\u00fcrzt, obgleich noch keine Langzeitstudien dazu vorliegen. Die sich abzeichnende Tendenz st\u00fctzt jedoch die Annahme. Es ist m\u00f6glich, ein CDC-Syndrom im Rahmen von Pr\u00e4nataldiagnostik mittels Amniozentese oder Chorionzottenbiopsie, bzw. durch die sich diesen Untersuchungen anschlie\u00dfende Chromosomenanalyse bereits vorgeburtlich zu diagnostizieren."}

Neuere Forschungsarbeiten weisen darauf hin, dass auch die Lesest\u00f6rung isoliert auftreten kann und sich zudem von der isolierten Rechtschreibst\u00f6rung unterscheidet, da die St\u00f6rungsbilder mit jeweils unterschiedlichen Problemen im Arbeitsged\u00e4chtnis, einem Teilbereich des Gehirns, einhergehen. Die St\u00f6rungen k\u00f6nnen zwar auch in Kombination auftreten, h\u00e4ngen aber demnach nicht zusammen. Anders als in der ICD-10 finden sich im DSM-5 aus diesem Grund getrennte Kategorien f\u00fcr St\u00f6rung des Lesens, des Schreibens, der mathematischen Kompetenzen sowie aller Kombinationen dieser Lernst\u00f6rungen. Zu Beginn des Schriftspracherwerbs k\u00f6nnen Probleme beim Aufsagen des Alphabets, der Benennung von Buchstaben oder dem Bilden von Reimen auftreten.

Alle Kinder, die das Lesen und Schreiben erlernen, machen anf\u00e4nglich die gleichen Fehler in verschieden starkem Ausma\u00df. Bei den meisten Kindern nehmen die Probleme jedoch sehr rasch ab und verschwinden schlie\u00dflich weitgehend. Kinder mit Legasthenie machen die Fehler wesentlich h\u00e4ufiger und die Probleme bleiben \u00fcber lange Zeit stabil. Auff\u00e4llig ist besonders, dass die Fehler kaum Konstanz erkennen lassen: Weder ist es m\u00f6glich, stabile Fehlerprofile zu ermitteln, noch gibt es eine bestimmte Systematik der Fehler. Ein und dasselbe Wort wird immer wieder unterschiedlich falsch geschrieben. Auch wenn eine Legasthenie nicht anhand der Fehlertypen diagnostiziert werden kann, so hat sich doch unter therapeutischen Gesichtspunkten eine Unterteilung der Fehler in die folgenden Fehlerarten als hilfreich erwiesen: - Phonemfehler als Verst\u00f6\u00dfe gegen die lautgetreue Schreibung (Verst\u00f6\u00dfe gegen die Buchstaben-Laut-Zuordnungsregeln, Probleme bei der Wortdurchgliederung: Auslassungen, Verdrehungen, Hinzuf\u00fcgungen) - Regelfehler als Verst\u00f6\u00dfe gegen die regelhaften Abweichungen von der lautgetreuen Schreibung (Ableitungsfehler, Gro\u00df-/Kleinschreibungsfehler) - Speicherfehler oder Merkfehler als Verst\u00f6\u00dfe gegen die regelhaften Abweichungen - Restfehler Zur Entstehung einer Lese- und Rechtschreibst\u00f6rung k\u00f6nnen vielf\u00e4ltige Ursachen beitragen, wobei in aller Regel verschiedene Faktoren zusammenwirken. Andererseits f\u00fchren einzelne Einfl\u00fcsse, wie etwa eine genetische Disposition nicht zwangsl\u00e4ufig zur Herausbildung einer Lernst\u00f6rung, sondern k\u00f6nnen durch pr\u00e4ventive Ma\u00dfnahmen im Vorschulalter und weitere intensive Betreuung w\u00e4hrend der gesamten Schul- und Ausbildungszeit kompensiert werden. Derzeit werden unter anderem die folgenden Ursachen diskutiert: 1. Genetik: Da in Familien h\u00e4ufig mehrere Familienmitglieder von LRS betroffen sind, wird in j\u00fcngerer Zeit verst\u00e4rkt eine genetische Komponente diskutiert. Da die Konkordanz f\u00fcr die Lese- und Rechtschreibst\u00f6rung bei eineiigen Zwillingen 68 %, bei zweieiigen Zwillingen hingegen nur 38 % betr\u00e4gt, ist ein substantieller genetischer Einfluss nicht von der Hand zu weisen."}

Durch die Erniedrigung der Zahl der neutrophilen Granulozyten wird eine vor\u00fcbergehende Unterdr\u00fcckung des Immunsystems hervorgerufen. Ausma\u00df und Dauer der Neutropenie und somit das Risiko von Infektionen h\u00e4ngen auch von der Art der Sch\u00e4digung ab. Neutrophile werden in akuten Entz\u00fcndungen in gro\u00dfem Umfang verbraucht. Wenn der Bedarf dabei die Bildungskapazit\u00e4t im Knochenmark \u00fcbersteigt, kommt es zu einer Abnahme der Zellzahl im Blut. Dabei kann gleichzeitig eine Linksverschiebung auftreten, weil nur noch unreife Neutrophile und Metamyelozyten (Vorl\u00e4uferzellen der Neutrophilen) freigesetzt werden. Daher kommt eine Neutropenie vor allem in der akuten Phase sehr schwerer Allgemeinerkrankungen wie Sepsis, Peritonitis (Bauchfellentz\u00fcndung), Metritis oder gangr\u00e4noser Mastitis vor. Eine gest\u00f6rte Bildung Neutrophiler (Dysgranulopoese) kann ebenfalls eine Neutropenie verursachen. Sie kann durch einen arretierten Entwicklungszyklus oder durch reduzierte Knochenmarksfreisetzung trotz ausreichender Bildung begr\u00fcndet sein. M\u00f6gliche Krankheitsursachen sind die Myelodysplasie, die akute myeloische Leuk\u00e4mie und virale Infektionen (AIDS, Immundefizienzsyndrom der Katzen, Katzenleuk\u00e4mie). Eine angeborene Neutropenie tritt beim Kostmann-Syndrom und der Glykogenose Typ 1b auf. Eine Verlagerung der Neutrophilen aus dem zirkulierenden Anteil in den sogenannten marginalen Neutrophilenpool (an die Endothelzellen kleiner Blutgef\u00e4\u00dfe gebundene Neutrophile) kann eine akute, aber vor\u00fcbergehende Neutropenie verursachen.

Au\u00dferdem sp\u00fcrt der Betroffene einen Druck- und Bewegungsschmerz. Der Patient legt automatisch den Oberarm in Schonhaltung an, wodurch sich die Schulter deutlich nach vorne neigt.

Pockenviren sind mit 200 bis 400 nm die gr\u00f6\u00dften bekannten animalen Viren. Diese Viren sind auch hinsichtlich ihrer DNA-Replikation im Cytoplasma im Vergleich zu anderen DNA-Viren ungew\u00f6hnlich. Eine mit einem Pockenvirus infizierte Zelle weist eine DNA-Synthese au\u00dferhalb des Kerns auf, was sonst nur in intrazellul\u00e4ren Organellen wie Mitochondrien (und bei Pflanzen in Chloroplasten) oder bei der Reifung des Hepatitis-B-Virus innerhalb des Kapsids im Cytoplasma vorkommt. F\u00fcr Pockenviren ist eine zweite Membranstruktur innerhalb des Virions charakteristisch, die innerhalb der Virush\u00fclle liegt und w\u00e4hrend dem Zusammenbau des intrazellul\u00e4ren Viruspartikles de novo um das Kapsid herum synthetisiert wird. Neben den Pockenerkrankungen des Menschen gibt es auch bei einer Reihe von Tieren durch verwandte Viren ausgel\u00f6ste Erkrankungen."}

Tag) und einer dorsalen Ausknospung (etwa 26. Tag) des Duodenums hervor. Nach einer durch unterschiedliche Wachstumsgeschwindigkeiten bedingten physiologischen Drehung des Duodenums resultiert eine Verschmelzung des Ausf\u00fchrungsganges der Pankreas mit dem sp\u00e4teren Ductus choledochus (mit Variationen) und einer Verschmelzung beider Pankreasanlagen. Das Ausf\u00fchrungsgangsystem l\u00e4sst sp\u00e4ter noch diese Entwicklung erkennen. Etwa in der 9. Woche bildet sich der endokrine Anteil. Dieser geht aus dem Epithel der Pankreasg\u00e4nge hervor und differenziert sich weiter zu den so genannten Langerhans-Inseln. Bald darauf beginnt bereits die Hormonproduktion, w\u00e4hrend der exokrine Teil in der Fetalzeit noch funktionslos bleibt. Man vermutet, dass das von den Betazellen produzierte Hormon Insulin eine wichtige Rolle in der Wachstumsregulation spielt. Hinweis hierzu ist der mehr als drei Mal so hohe prozentuale Anteil der Betazellen im Fetus im Vergleich zum Erwachsenen. Kommt es bei der ventralen Pankreasanlage zur Bildung von zwei Lappen mit einer zur dorsalen Richtung zus\u00e4tzlichen Weiterentwicklung Richtung ventral bzw. Fixierung des ventralen Teils, bildet sich ein Ring um das Pars descendens des Duodenums mit Folge einer potentiellen Einengung dessen Lumens. Je nach Ausma\u00df der Passagebehinderung kann das bereits im Mutterleib, als Neugeborenes oder erst im 3. oder 4. Lebensjahrzehnt zutage treten, aber auch v\u00f6llig symptomlos bleiben. Die Diagnose wird mittels Sonografie, ERCP und CT gestellt. Typische Symptome sind (evtl. galliges) postprandiales Erbrechen (nach Nahrungszufuhr) und Bl\u00e4hungen.

Bei marinen Arten gilt Amyloodinium ocellatum als Ausl\u00f6ser der Krankheit. Eine Infektion findet \u00fcberwiegend durch Neuzug\u00e4nge statt, da der Parasit \u00fcber einen l\u00e4ngeren Zeitraum von mehr als 24 Stunden ohne einen passenden Wirt nicht lebensf\u00e4hig ist. Im Gegensatz zu seinem marinen Vertreter Amyloodinium ocellatum ern\u00e4hrt sich Piscinoodinium pillulare nicht von Zellbestandteilen seines Wirtes, sondern besitzt aufgrund der Chloroplasten in seinen Zellen photosynthetische F\u00e4higkeiten. Die Haut wird dennoch durch die wurzelartigen Plasmaf\u00e4den massiv gesch\u00e4digt und aufgel\u00f6st. Seltener treten zus\u00e4tzlich Entz\u00fcndungen oder Verpilzungen in Erscheinung. Im anf\u00e4nglichen Stadium sind die Kiemen befallen, wo sich der Parasit ausbreitet und beim Fisch eine starke Atemnot verursacht. Dabei kann die Fischhaut v\u00f6llig frei vom Parasiten erscheinen, und erst wenn die Zyste verlassen wurde, verbreitet sich P. pillulare kriechend \u00fcber die gesamte Hautoberfl\u00e4che. Der Krankheitsverlauf ist chronisch \u00fcber mehrere Wochen und selbst in einem Abstrich schwer zu erkennen, da sich der Parasit kaum von Schleimhautzellen unterscheiden l\u00e4sst. Im weiteren Verlauf kommt es durch die massenhafte Ausbreitung des Parasiten zu einer Zerst\u00f6rung des Zellverbundes, mit Absterben des Gewebes, bis zu fetzenartigem Abl\u00f6sen der Haut und auftretenden Blutungen innerhalb der Kiemenbl\u00e4ttchen. Unbehandelt endet die Krankheit f\u00fcr den Fisch immer t\u00f6dlich und ist mit einem langen Siechtum verbunden.

Im k\u00e4lteren Teichwasser dauert die Entwicklung l\u00e4nger als bei Warmwasserfischen und Temperaturen von 25 \u00b0C und dar\u00fcber. Wird die Temperatur zur Behandlung erh\u00f6ht, um den Lebenszyklus des Parasiten zu beschleunigen, besteht ein hohes Risiko, dass der befallene Fisch, aufgrund der massenhaften Ausbreitung im Kiemengewebe, durch Sauerstoffmangel stirbt. Eine Behandlung gegen P. pillulare im aquaristischen Bereich sollte, aufgrund seiner photosynthetischen Eigenschaften, ohne Beleuchtung erfolgen. Als Medikamente kommen Chininhydrochlorid (verschreibungspflichtig) oder Kupfersulfat (Vorsicht bei niederen Tieren und Welsen) in Frage. Im freiverk\u00e4uflichen Handel sind Wirkstoffe mit 2-Amino-5-nitrothiazol ebenso wirksam gegen Piscinoodinium pillulare."}

Am Gleitlager der Kniescheibe kommt es vielfach zu einer ungleichm\u00e4\u00dfigen Lastverteilung in diesem Gelenkabschnitt. Die Streckmuskulatur des Oberschenkels kann innerhalb kurzer Zeit (14 Tage) auf eine eingeschr\u00e4nkte Belastbarkeit des Knies reagieren, der k\u00f6rpermittig gelegene Bauch dieses Muskels (Quadriceps, der Vierk\u00f6pfige) verliert schnell an Kraft mit der Folge, dass die Last auf die Kniescheibenr\u00fcckfl\u00e4che verlagert wird.

Damit ist ein gen\u00fcgender Austausch gegeben, solange die Auflagelast im physiologischen Bereich bleibt. Das System vertr\u00e4gt weder zu viel noch zu wenig Druck. Weicht dieser Druck weit genug vom Idealbereich ab, kommt es zu Knorpelern\u00e4hrungsst\u00f6rungen.

Nach den 1960er Jahren nahm die Erw\u00e4hnung der Managerkrankheit ab und man findet die Begriffsverwendung heute nur noch selten.

Eine historisch-medizinische Zusammenfassung der Sichtweisen auf die Managerkrankheit findet sich bei Patrick Kury in Der \u00fcberforderte Mensch: Eine Wissensgeschichte vom Stress zum Burnout. Michael Bauer bezeichnete 1953 die Managerkrankheit als \u201ebesten Zeugen\u201c f\u00fcr verschiedene \u201eZivilisationssch\u00e4den\u201c und machte daf\u00fcr \u201e\u00dcberanstrengung bis zur Ersch\u00f6pfung, Mangel an Schlaf und echter Erholung, \u00dcberforderung der Leistungsf\u00e4higkeit, geringe Bewegung, \u00fcberm\u00e4ssigen Gebrauch an Genussmitteln jeder Art\u201c verantwortlich. Als Pr\u00e4sident des Deutschen B\u00e4derverbandes lag sein Vorschlag f\u00fcr eine Behandlung nahe. Auf die immer h\u00e4ufiger werdende mediale Verbreitung der Managerkrankheit reagierte der Arzt und Professor Alfred Marchionini, indem er 1956 in M\u00fcnchen in Anlehnung an das Prinzip des English weekend die Gesellschaft \u201eFreies Wochenende\u201c mit dem Ziel gr\u00fcndete, \u201edie Reinigung des Sonnabends und des Sonntags von allen Massenveranstaltungen, Kongressen und politischen Versammlungen\u201c (ausgenommen: die religi\u00f6sen und sportlichen Veranstaltungen) durchzuf\u00fchren und auch, um \u201eder sonnabend-sonnt\u00e4glichen Jagd nach \u00dcberstunden ein Ende zu bereiten\u201c. Die \u201eAktion Freies Wochenende\u201c sollte der Managerkrankheit entgegenwirken, aber auch damals schon nicht nur Managern, sondern jedermann zugutekommen. Die Managerkrankheit, besonders mit Todesfolge, wurde in medizinischen Fachkreisen als ein \u201eElitenph\u00e4nomen\u201c wahrgenommen, doch Mediziner, die diese Ansicht vertraten, stellten sie meist in den Raum, ohne sie mit konkreten Zahlen zu belegen. Auch eine 1953 von Otto Graf im Auftrage des Deutschen Gesundheits-Museums K\u00f6ln auf einer vagen empirischen Basis durchgef\u00fchrte Studie mit dem Titel Die Krankheit der Verantwortlichen. Manager-Krankheit kam zum selben Ergebnis. Es gab aber auch kritische Hinweise, dass Managertod als Folge von Managerkrankheit differenzierter zu betrachten und dann als \u201eFabel\u201c zu erkennen sei. Grundlage war beispielsweise 1954 die Untersuchung von Versicherungsdaten der Victoria Versicherung, bei der man zu der Schlussfolgerung kam: \u201eDas untersuchte Material (etwa 25. 000 leitende Personen mit 1. 179 Todesf\u00e4llen in drei bis f\u00fcnf Beobachtungsjahren) erbrachte nicht den Beweis, da\u00df gegenw\u00e4rtig in der Bundesrepublik allgemein und f\u00fcr einen l\u00e4ngeren Beobachtungszeitraum eine \u00dcbersterblichkeit der leitenden Pers\u00f6nlichkeiten besteht."}

M\u00e4dchen sind etwas h\u00e4ufiger betroffen als Jungen. Ursache ist der Verlust eines kleinen Abschnitts (Deletion) am Ende des kurzen Arms von Chromosom 4. Die beschriebenen Deletionen sind unterschiedlich gro\u00df. Derjenige kleinste Abschnitt, dessen Verlust zu den typischen Symptomen f\u00fchrt, das hei\u00dft die sogenannte kritische Region, ist eine etwa 165 Kilobasenpaare gro\u00dfe Region in der Bande 4p16. 3. Etwa 85-87 % aller Deletionen entstehen im betroffenen Individuum neu (de novo) und zwar meist im v\u00e4terlichen Chromosom, werden also nicht von einem der Eltern geerbt. Bei De-novo-Deletionen besteht kein erh\u00f6htes Wiederholungsrisiko f\u00fcr weitere Nachkommen der Eltern. Bis zu 15 % der Wolf-Hirschhorn-Syndrome werden durch sogenannte balancierte Translokationen bei einem Elternteil verursacht. Hierbei betr\u00e4gt das Wiederholungsrisiko bei weiteren Kindern 50 %. Alle Kinder haben charakteristische Gesichtsfehlbildungen mit vergr\u00f6\u00dfertem Augenabstand (Hypertelorismus), nach unten abfallenden Lidachsen, einer breiten Nase, einem verk\u00fcrzten Philtrum, kleinem Kiefer (Mikrognathie), nach unten stehenden Mundwinkeln und Ohranh\u00e4ngseln oder -gr\u00fcbchen.

Der abschlie\u00dfende gemeinsame Weg zur Entwicklung eines Angio\u00f6dems ist vermutlich die Aktivierung des Bradykininwegs. Dieses Peptid ist ein potenter Vasodilatator, der zu einer raschen Fl\u00fcssigkeitsansammlung im Interstitium f\u00fchrt. Dies tritt am deutlichsten im Gesicht zutage, wo die Haut \u00fcber verh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfig wenig st\u00fctzendes Bindegewebe verf\u00fcgt, und sich ein \u00d6dem leicht entwickeln kann.

Verschiedene Mechanismen, die die Bildung oder den Abbau von Bradykinin st\u00f6rend beeinflussen, k\u00f6nnen zum Angio\u00f6dem f\u00fchren. ACE-Hemmer blockieren die Funktion der Kininase II, des Enzyms, das Bradykinin abbaut.

Dieser Serinproteasehemmer (Serpin) hemmt normalerweise die Umwandlung von C1 zu C1r und C1s, die \u2013 wiederum \u2013 andere Proteine des Komplementsystems aktivieren. Au\u00dferdem hemmt er verschiedene Proteine der Gerinnungskaskade, obgleich die Auswirkungen seines Mangels auf die Entwicklung von H\u00e4morrhagie und Thrombose begrenzt zu sein scheinen.

Bei Lichtbestrahlung kann sich auf der durch diese Substanzen photosensibilisierten Haut durch das Zusammentreffen der photosensibilisierenden Substanzen und Licht eine Dermatose entwickeln. Ursache dieser Hautver\u00e4nderungen sind phototoxische oder photoallergische Reaktionen. Diese Dermatosen werden deshalb je nach Ursache als phototoxische Dermatose oder photoallergische Dermatose bezeichnet.

Die koronare Herzkrankheit wird in vielen Lehrb\u00fcchern und in der nationalen Versorgungsleitlinie der Bundes\u00e4rztekammer als die Manifestation der Arteriosklerose an den Herzkranzarterien definiert. Dar\u00fcber hinaus gibt es auch eine etwas weiter gefasste Definition. Hiernach entsteht die koronare Herzkrankheit durch eine Koronarinsuffizienz, bei der neben der Arteriosklerose noch zahlreiche andere Ursachen zugrunde liegen k\u00f6nnen. Unabh\u00e4ngig davon, welche Definition zugrunde gelegt wird, ist die Arteriosklerose die Hauptursache der koronaren Herzkrankheit. Andere Ursachen treten sehr h\u00e4ufig in Kombination mit der Arteriosklerose auf. F\u00fcr die Arteriosklerose gibt es zahlreiche Risikofaktoren, deren Vermeidung f\u00fcr die Vorbeugung (Pr\u00e4vention) dieser Erkrankung eine wichtige Rolle spielt. Die Arteriosklerose (Arterienverkalkung) oder Atherosklerose ist die h\u00e4ufigste Systemerkrankung von Arterien. Im Volksmund wird sie auch als Arterienverkalkung bezeichnet. Nach der Definition der Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) ist die Arteriosklerose eine variable Kombination von Ver\u00e4nderungen der Gef\u00e4\u00dfinnenwand (Intima) der Arterien, bestehend aus herdf\u00f6rmiger Ansammlung von Fettsubstanzen, komplexen Kohlenhydraten, Blut und Blutbestandteilen, Bindegewebe und Kalziumablagerungen, verbunden mit Ver\u00e4nderungen der Gef\u00e4\u00dfmuskelschicht (Media). Diese Ver\u00e4nderungen f\u00fchren zu Verh\u00e4rtung der Gef\u00e4\u00dfw\u00e4nde, was mit einem Elastizit\u00e4tsverlust einhergeht, sowie zu einer Verengung der Gef\u00e4\u00dflichtung durch Wandverdickungen (arteriosklerotische Plaques) und sekund\u00e4re Thrombosen. Dadurch wird die Durchblutung des Herzmuskels eingeschr\u00e4nkt. In Abh\u00e4ngigkeit vom Ausma\u00df der Arteriosklerose kann der Herzmuskel bei k\u00f6rperlicher Belastung und psychischer Erregung oder bereits in Ruhe nicht mehr ausreichend durchblutet werden (Koronarinsuffizienz). Die Entstehung der Arteriosklerose ist ein in Stadien ablaufender, schleichender und fortschreitender Prozess, der \u00fcber viele Jahre bis Jahrzehnte andauert. Zahlreiche Risikofaktoren beg\u00fcnstigen die Entstehung der Arteriosklerose. Die Risikofaktoren f\u00fcr die Entstehung einer koronaren Arteriosklerose bei KHK und der entsprechenden Gef\u00e4\u00dfver\u00e4nderungen bei anderen Erkrankungen, beispielsweise der peripheren arteriellen Verschlusskrankheit, unterscheiden sich nur unwesentlich. Allerdings gibt es einen spezifischen Bezug der Risikofaktoren zur KHK, der insbesondere hinsichtlich epidemiologischer Daten von Bedeutung ist. Zu den Risikofaktoren geh\u00f6ren vom Patienten nicht beeinflussbare oder konstitutionelle Risiken, wie eine genetische Pr\u00e4disposition, das Alter und das Geschlecht des Patienten. Zu den durch den Patienten beeinflussbaren Risikofaktoren geh\u00f6ren Fettstoffwechselst\u00f6rungen im Allgemeinen und ein erh\u00f6hter Cholesterinspiegel (Hypercholesterin\u00e4mie) im Speziellen, \u00dcbergewicht, Tabakrauchen, arterielle Hypertonie (arterieller Bluthochdruck), Diabetes mellitus, Bewegungsmangel und psychosoziale Faktoren. Die einzelnen Risikofaktoren wirken nicht nur additiv, sondern erh\u00f6hen zusammen das kardiovaskul\u00e4re Risiko \u00fcberproportional (synergistisch)."}

Mehr als 90 % aller Jugendlichen waren bis zum 14. Lebensjahr infiziert. Ein Herpes Zoster trat gew\u00f6hnlich jenseits des 40. Lebensjahres auf.

Eine Krankheitsh\u00e4ufung besteht im Winter und Fr\u00fchjahr. Der Erreger der Windpocken ist das Varizella-Zoster-Virus (VZV), das gem\u00e4\u00df der Virus-Taxonomie auch als Humanes Herpesvirus 3 (HHV-3) bezeichnet wird. Einziges bekanntes Reservoir ist der Mensch. Dieses Virus ist ein beh\u00fclltes, doppelstr\u00e4ngiges DNA-Virus (dsDNA) und geh\u00f6rt zur Familie der Herpesviridae, zur Unterfamilie Alphaherpesvirinae und zur Gattung Varicellovirus. Alle Viren dieser Familie umschlie\u00dfen ihre DNA mit einem ikosaedrischen Kapsid, einer aus Dreiecksfl\u00e4chen bestehenden Proteinh\u00fclle. Das Varizella-Zoster-Virus ist weltweit verbreitet und wird bereits in der Kindheit \u00fcbertragen. Exemplarisch stieg bei Kindern in Schweden zwischen 9 und 12 Jahren in den letzten 30 Jahren die Pr\u00e4valenz von Antik\u00f6rpern gegen VZV von etwa 50 % Ende der 1960er Jahre bis auf 98 % 1997, was der zunehmend verbreiteten Impfung zugeschrieben wird. Bei der erwachsenen Bev\u00f6lkerung in Mitteleuropa sind bei etwa 93 bis 96 % Antik\u00f6rper nachweisbar. Die vom Erreger verursachte Windpocken-Erkrankung als Erstinfektion des VZV nimmt nur sehr selten einen t\u00f6dlichen Verlauf; dies kann gelegentlich ohne Vorerkrankung bei Patienten mit intaktem Immunsystem vorkommen, h\u00e4ufiger jedoch bei Immundefizienten und Schwangeren. Dies zeigt auch, dass das VZV sehr stark an den Menschen als seinen einzigen Wirt angepasst ist und es daher als \u201ewirtsspezifisch und teiladaptiert\u201c eingestuft werden kann. Es verbleibt nach einer Infektion stets lebenslang als DNA-Ring im Nukleoplasma der Nervenzellen der Spinal- oder Hirnnervenganglien.

Das parallele Vorliegen mehrerer Karyotypen innerhalb eines Organismus wird in der Genetik als Mosaik bezeichnet. Der Karyotyp der Mosaik-Trisomie 9 lautet daher 46,XX/47XX+9 bzw. 46,XY/47XY+9. Diese chromosomale Besonderheit liegt meist als Translokations-Form vor und ist sehr selten. Seit der Erstbeschreibung des Syndroms im Jahre 1970 durch die franz\u00f6sische Genetikerin Marie-Odile Rethor\u00e9 sind \u00fcber 100 Fallbeispiele bekannt. Es gibt offenbar eine famili\u00e4re H\u00e4ufung, sofern bei einem der Elternteile eine sogenannte Balancierte Translokation des entsprechenden Chromosomenabschnitts vorliegt: Eine Balancierte Translokation entsteht dadurch, dass sich ein ganzes Chromosom oder ein Teilabschnitt an ein anderes Chromosom anlagert. Dadurch wird jedoch die Menge des Erbmaterials nicht ver\u00e4ndert. Die genetischen Informationen sind somit trotz der ver\u00e4nderten Position im Gleichgewicht, also balanciert. Bei Menschen mit dem Rethor\u00e9-Syndrom liegt eine partielle (= teilweise, anteilige) Verdreifachung des Chromosoms 9 vor: Hierbei besteht nur eine Trisomie des kurzen Arms des 9. Chromosoms (9pter-q1), meist in Verbindung mit einer Translokation des entsprechenden Chromosomenabschnittes auf ein anderes Chromosom. Die Partielle Trisomie 9 (mit oder ohne Translokation) l\u00e4sst sich vorgeburtlich (pr\u00e4natal) durch eine Amniozentese oder eine Chorionzottenbiopsie bzw. durch die sich diesen Untersuchungen anschlie\u00dfende Chromosomenanalyse mit spezieller Locus-Sonde oder nachgeburtlich (postnatal) durch die Untersuchung des Blutes des betreffenden Kindes nachweisen, wobei in den meisten F\u00e4llen die Kinder bereits w\u00e4hrend der Schwangerschaft (in der Regel in sehr fr\u00fchen Stadien) sterben und die Schwangerschaft mit einer oft unbemerkten Fehlgeburt endet.

Sie reicht zu diesem Zeitpunkt noch nicht bis zur Spitze des Penis. Der distale Abschnitt der Urethra bildet sich im vierten SSM durch Zellen des Ektoderm, die zuerst einen Epithelstrang bilden, der auf den Hohlraum, den die Harnr\u00f6hre zu diesem Zeitpunkt bildet, zuw\u00e4chst.

Da sich bei Phytans\u00e4ure an der \u03b2-Position eine Methylgruppe befindet, kann diese Fetts\u00e4ure nicht direkt durch mitochondriale oder peroxisomale \u03b2-Oxidation metabolisiert werden. Demnach wird sie der peroxisomalen \u03b1-Oxidation unterzogen, f\u00fcr die das Enzym Phytanoyl\u2013CoA-Hydroxylase verantwortlich ist. Ist dieses Enzym defekt, kommt es zum klinischen Erscheinungsbild des Morbus Refsum.

Die chronische Herzinsuffizienz entwickelt sich im Verlauf von Monaten bis Jahren. Sie ist charakterisiert durch Kompensationsprozesse des Organismus (schnellerer Herzschlag, Verdickung des Herzmuskels, Engstellung der Blutgef\u00e4\u00dfe, Vermehrung des Blutvolumens usw. ), was die verminderte Pumpleistung des Herzens eine Zeit lang ausgleichen kann.

Die ZSD ist eine Erkrankung, bei der es von Beginn an zu einem starken Verlust der Sehsch\u00e4rfe kommt und die im weiteren Verlauf mit variabler Geschwindigkeit fortschreitet. Der Name (Zapfen-St\u00e4bchen-Dystrophie) gibt bereits einige Aufschl\u00fcsse \u00fcber die Erkrankung. Bei der Namensbildung werden die Zapfen als Erstes benannt, da sie bei diesem Krankheitsbild am st\u00e4rksten betroffen sind. Sie haben ihre h\u00f6chste Dichte im Sehzentrum (Makula), so dass es bereits mit Krankheitsbeginn zu zentralen Gesichtsfeldausf\u00e4llen kommen kann, die es dem Betroffenen unm\u00f6glich machen, anvisierte Objekte zu sehen. Da die Stelle des sch\u00e4rfsten Sehens verlorengeht, kommt es h\u00e4ufig zum Augenzittern (Nystagmus) oder zu einer Fehlstellung der Augen (Strabismus). Der zunehmende Verlust der Zapfen f\u00fchrt zu St\u00f6rungen bei der Anpassung an verschiedene Lichtverh\u00e4ltnisse, somit zu einer erh\u00f6hten Blendempfindlichkeit, welche das Sehen bei hellem Licht bedeutend beeintr\u00e4chtigt. Auch das Erkennen von Farben ist fr\u00fch gest\u00f6rt. Da die St\u00e4bchen zu Beginn der Erkrankung kaum betroffen sind, ist das Sehen in der D\u00e4mmerung noch gut m\u00f6glich. Erst im sp\u00e4teren Verlauf werden auch die mittleren und \u00e4u\u00dferen Bereiche der Netzhaut und damit die St\u00e4bchen betroffen. Der Begriff Dystrophie, der am Namensende steht, sagt aus, dass es sich bei dieser Erkrankung um eine angeborene langsam fortschreitende Zerst\u00f6rung des Gewebes handelt. Ursache daf\u00fcr sind Mutationen in verschiedenen Genen. Die Vererbung ist in den meisten F\u00e4llen autosomal rezessiv. Es kommt aber auch eine autosomal dominante oder x-chromosomale Vererbung vor. Diese Mutationen f\u00fchren zu St\u00f6rungen in der Signal\u00fcbertragung und zu Ver\u00e4nderungen des Aufbaus sowie der Funktion der Zapfen. In anderen F\u00e4llen kann es zur Nichtbildung des Sehpurpurs kommen oder auch zu einer St\u00f6rung des Stofftransports durch die Zellmembran. Bei relativ vielen ZSD-Betroffenen wurden Mutationen im ABCA4-Gen lokalisiert, das verantwortlich f\u00fcr die Kodierung eines Transportproteins im Vitamin-A-Stoffwechsel ist."}

Neben einer obligaten autonomen Dysfunktion ist fehlendes Ansprechen auf L-DOPA ein wichtiges Kriterium zur Abgrenzung vom Morbus Parkinson. Einige klinische Zeichen sind als Hinweis auf eine m\u00f6gliche Multisystematrophie zu beachten, wie Dysphagie, Dysarthrie, inspiratorischer Stridor, fr\u00fche Fallneigung und schneller Krankheitsfortschritt.

Definitionsgem\u00e4\u00df ist dabei der Bedarf zum Zeitpunkt eines korrigierten Alters von 36 Schwangerschaftswochen (SSW) ma\u00dfgebend. Man unterscheidet zwischen einer milden (mit 36 SSW kein erh\u00f6hter Sauerstoffbedarf mehr), moderaten (weniger als 30 % Sauerstoff in der Einatemluft notwendig) und schweren Verlaufsform (mehr als 30 % und/oder Beatmung bzw. Atemunterst\u00fctzung durch CPAP notwendig). Ma\u00dfnahmen zur Vorbeugung gegen BPD sind: Vermeidung von Fr\u00fchgeburtlichkeit, Lungenreifeinduktion vor der Geburt mit Gabe von Kortikosteroiden an die Mutter, Vermeidung von Infektionen, schonende m\u00f6glichst kurzzeitige Beatmung unter Inkaufnahme auch von erh\u00f6hten Kohlendioxid-Blutgaswerten, fr\u00fchzeitige Diagnose und Verschluss eines offen gebliebenen Ductus arteriosus, eventuell Vitamin-A-Gaben an das Kind. Die Anwendung von Surfactant bei Fr\u00fchgeborenen mit Atemnotsyndrom, die Ende der 1980er Jahre eingef\u00fchrt wurde, hat die \u00dcberlebenschancen fr\u00fchgeborener Kinder mit BPD erheblich verbessert, verhindert allerdings nicht das Auftreten von BPD. Die Behandlung mit systemischen Kortikosteroiden wie Dexamethason f\u00fchrt zu einer schnellen Verbesserung der Lungenfunktion und kann bei sehr fr\u00fcher Gabe (in den ersten 96 Lebensstunden) auch zu einer Verringerung des Auftretens von BPD f\u00fchren, allerdings sind bei fr\u00fchzeitiger Gabe auch die Nebenwirkungen schwerer und h\u00e4ufiger. Eine systemische Kortikoidbehandlung beg\u00fcnstigt das Auftreten von Zerebralparesen. Die Gabe von Sauerstoff zur Aufrechterhaltung einer Sauerstoffs\u00e4ttigung des Blutes von > 92 % ist die vordergr\u00fcndige Therapie."}

Dadurch entstehen so genannte Lipoproteine, die sich \u00fcber das ganze Blut verteilen.

Die vollgefressenen Makrophagen, die normalerweise nach erfolgreichem \u201eVertilgen\u201c der oxidierten Fette aus der Gef\u00e4\u00dfwand austreten, sind nicht mehr in Lage, dies zu tun, da sich \u00fcber ihnen w\u00e4hrend des Fressvorganges eine endotheliale Zellschicht gebildet hat.

Dennoch spielt nicht nur die Vererbung eine Rolle. Auch andere Faktoren wie bestimmte Ern\u00e4hrung oder \u00dcbergewicht beeinflussen die Entstehung der St\u00f6rung.

Bodamer pr\u00e4gte auch den Begriff Prosopagnosie. Ins Deutsche wird er \u00fcblicherweise mit Gesichtsblindheit \u00fcbertragen. Prosopagnosie wird in drei verschiedene Typen unterschieden: - apperzeptive Prosopagnosie (in etwa \u201ebewusst wahrgenommen\u201c) - assoziative (oder amnestische) Prosopagnosie - Kongenitale (angeborene) Prosopagnosie Verletzungen im ventralen Pfad zwischen Okzipital- und Temporallappen, z.

Er beginnt beim Menschen ab der 5. Embryonalwoche. Der erfolgreiche Abstieg in den Hodensack (Skrotum) ist beim Menschen eines der Reifezeichen des Neugeborenen. Es gibt die Annahme, dass die Einnahme von Analgetika w\u00e4hrend der Schwangerschaft zu einem erh\u00f6hten Risiko von Hodenhochstand f\u00fchren kann. Ungef\u00e4hr 3\u20136 % der reifen m\u00e4nnlichen Neugeborenen und etwa 30 % der Fr\u00fchgeborenen (aber 100 % aller m\u00e4nnlichen Fr\u00fchgeburten mit einem Geburtsgewicht von weniger als 900 Gramm) weisen noch eine ein- oder beidseitige Lageanomalie des Hodens auf. Nach Ende des ersten Lebensjahres ist das Vorkommen auf ca. 0,7 % gesunken. Bei den Tieren kann der Hodenabstieg allerdings auch erst nach der Geburt abgeschlossen sein, wie beispielsweise bei Pferden oder bei Hunden, oder erst zur Pubert\u00e4t erfolgen (Nagetiere, Hasenartige). Die Pr\u00e4valenz f\u00fcr Lageanomalien des Hodens beim Haushund liegt zwischen 0,8 und 10 %, wobei in drei Viertel der F\u00e4lle nur ein Hoden betroffen ist. Rassepr\u00e4dispositionen liegen bei Toy Pudel, Dackel, Yorkshire Terrier, Chihuahua, Malteser, Pekinese, Zwergschnauzer, Cocker-Spaniel und Boxer vor. Die Lageanomalien des Hodens k\u00f6nnen in zwei Gruppen eingeteilt werden. Der Hodenhochstand (Hodenretention) ist ein ausgebliebener bzw. unvollst\u00e4ndiger Abstieg des Hodens, die Hodenektopie eine Abweichung vom vorgegebenen Pfad. Entsprechend dem Wanderungsende unterscheidet man: - Kryptorchismus: Entsprechend der griechischen Bedeutung von kryptos (verborgen) ist der Hoden nicht auffindbar. Er liegt in der Regel im Bauchraum \u2013 Retentio testis abdominalis oder Nondescensus testis (\u201eBauchhoden\u201c). Davon muss eine fehlende Hodenanlage, die Anorchie, abgegrenzt werden. In der urologischen Praxis wird der Begriff allerdings oft weit gefasst und f\u00fcr alle Anomalien verwendet, bei denen der Hoden nicht haupts\u00e4chlich im Skrotum anzufinden ist. - Leistenhoden: Der Abstieg des Hodens aus dem Bauchraum ist im Leistenkanal zum Stillstand gekommen \u2013 Retentio testis inguinalis - Gleithoden: Der Hoden l\u00e4sst sich wohl durch sanften Druck in den Hodensack verlagern, nimmt aber seine urspr\u00fcngliche Position im Leistenkanal aufgrund eines zu kurzen Samenstranges sofort wieder ein. - Pendelhoden, Wanderhoden: Der Hoden befindet sich, zum Beispiel bei sexueller Erregung (siehe Kremasterreflex) abwechselnd im Leistenkanal und im Hodensack."}

Die meisten Patienten stellen sich mit den ersten Krankheitssymptomen bei Rheumatologen, Immunologen oder Kinder\u00e4rzten vor. Die Nierenbeteiligung entsteht erst sp\u00e4ter. Ursache des Muckle-Wells-Syndroms ist eine Missense-Mutation im Gen NLRP3 auf Chromosom 1. NLRP3 codiert f\u00fcr das Protein Cryopyrin. Cryopyrin ist an Apoptose- und Entz\u00fcndungssignalwegen beteiligt. Cryopyrin f\u00fchrt zu einer gesteigerten Bildung von Interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2). IL-1\u03b2 wiederum stimuliert w\u00e4hrend der Akute-Phase-Reaktion die Synthese von Serum-Amyloid-A-Protein durch Leberzellen (Hepatozyten). Mutationen im NLRP3-Gen f\u00fchren nicht nur zum Muckle-Wells-Syndrom, sondern k\u00f6nnen andere autoinflammatorische Erkrankungen hervorrufen. Im Gegensatz zu Autoimmunerkrankungen richten sich autoinflammatorische Erkrankungen nicht gegen das k\u00f6rpereigene Immunsystem, sondern produzieren Entz\u00fcndungsstoffe, die dem K\u00f6rper eine Entz\u00fcndung vorspielen, aber keine urs\u00e4chliche vorhanden ist. Die Therapie erfolgt mit Anakinra, einem rekombinanten Interleukin-1-Rezeptor-Antagonisten. Anakinra f\u00fchrt zu einer kompetitiven Hemmung der Bindung von IL-1\u03b1 und IL-1\u03b2 an den IL-1 Receptor Typ 1. Spricht die Behandlung mit Anakinra an, kommt es zur Besserung des H\u00f6rverm\u00f6gens, Abfall der Spiegel von C-reaktivem Protein, Besserung der Proteinurie sowie Verschwinden von Urticaria, Gelenkschmerzen und Fieber. Ein weiterer Wirkstoff, um MWS zu behandeln, ist Canakinumab (Ilaris, Novartis). Canakinumab ist ein monoklonaler Antik\u00f6rper (Interleukin-1\u00df-Hemmer) und wird meist in Abst\u00e4nden von 8 Wochen subkutan gespritzt. Erst k\u00fcrzlich hat Ilaris auch f\u00fcr andere Erkrankungen Zulassungen erhalten.

Ausschlaggebend f\u00fcr die Entstehung einer chronisch-ven\u00f6sen Insuffizienz ist das Vorhandensein eines pathologischen Bluthochdrucks der oberfl\u00e4chlichen Venen. Normal ist dieser bei 20 bis 30 mmHg, steigt jedoch durch ven\u00f6se Thrombose, prim\u00e4r oder sekund\u00e4r pathologische Venenklappen oder abgeschw\u00e4chte Muskelpumpe auf 60 bis 90 mmHg.

Lange Zeit nahm man an, das Capgras-Syndrom sei mit der Prosopagnosie, der generellen Unf\u00e4higkeit, Gesichter zu erkennen, verwandt. Neuere Forschungsarbeiten zeigen jedoch, dass die Gesichtserkennung ungest\u00f6rt ist, wohingegen die Verkn\u00fcpfung zu emotionalen K\u00f6rper-Reaktionen fehle. Das Fehlen einer emotionalen Reaktion kann beispielsweise durch die Elektrodermale Aktivit\u00e4t festgestellt werden, da sich der Hautwiderstand bei emotionalen Empfindungen wie beim Anblick vertrauter Personen \u00e4ndert. Das Syndrom wurde 1923 von dem franz\u00f6sischen Psychiater Jean Marie Joseph Capgras erstmals (zusammen mit seinem Mitarbeiter Jean Reboul-Lachaux) beschrieben und ist nach ihm benannt. Capgras und Reboul-Lachaux verwendeten in ihrer Arbeit die Bezeichnung l\u2019illusion des sosies (\u201edie Doppelg\u00e4nger-Illusion\u201c), um den Fall einer Madame M. zu beschreiben. In einem 1991 beschriebenen Fall einer Madame D. genannten Patientin erkannte diese alle nahen Verwandten problemlos wieder, behauptete jedoch, ihr Ehemann sei durch einen identisch aussehenden Doppelg\u00e4nger ausgetauscht worden. Zuerst hatte sie den ehelichen Beischlaf verweigert und das Schlafzimmer verriegelt. Schlie\u00dflich hatte sie ihren Sohn um ein Gewehr gebeten. Als sie mit Hilfe der Polizei psychiatrisch untergebracht werden sollte, zeigte sie erheblichen Widerstand. In einer \u00f6rtlichen psychiatrischen Klinik wurde die Diagnose einer atypischen Psychose gestellt, die sp\u00e4ter als Capgras-Syndrom eingestuft wurde."}

Diese Tumoren produzieren das Hormon Gastrin und werden daher auch Gastrinome genannt. Gastrinome z\u00e4hlen zu den neuroendokrinen Tumoren (NET), sie k\u00f6nnen einzeln oder als multiple Tumoren vorkommen. Etwa die H\u00e4lfte bis zwei Drittel der einzelnen Gastrinome sind b\u00f6sartige (maligne) Tumoren, die sich in Leber und Lymphknoten absiedeln k\u00f6nnen. Nahezu 25 % der Patienten mit Gastrinomen haben im Rahmen einer Multiplen endokrinen Neoplasie (MEN) Typ I mehrere Tumoren: die drei \u201eP\u201c pituitary (englisch f\u00fcr Hypophyse), pancreas (Bauchspeicheldr\u00fcse), parathyreoid (Nebenschilddr\u00fcse). Das von einem Gastrinom produzierte Gastrin verursacht eine \u00dcberproduktion von Magens\u00e4ure. Gastrin wirkt am Magen auf die Parietal-/Belegzellen und veranlasst diese, mehr Wasserstoffionen in das Magenlumen freizusetzen (Protonenpumpe). Der S\u00e4ureanstieg tr\u00e4gt zur Entwicklung von Magengeschw\u00fcren (Ulcera ventriculi) und Zw\u00f6lffingerdarm-Geschw\u00fcren (Ulcera duodeni) bei. F\u00fcr die Diagnose ist vor allem der erh\u00f6hte Gastrinspiegel (Hypergastrin\u00e4mie) wegweisend. Werte \u00fcber 1000 ng/l sind dabei fast beweisend. Im Gegensatz zu anderen Krankheiten, bei denen der Gastrinspiegel ebenfalls erh\u00f6ht sein kann, kommt es beim Zollinger-Ellison-Syndrom zus\u00e4tzlich nach Provokation mit Sekretin zu einem oft 100-prozentigen Anstieg des Gastrinspiegels. Neuroendokrine Tumoren bilden typischerweise Chromogranin, das im Serum nachgewiesen wird. Weiter k\u00f6nnen zur Diagnosesicherung die therapieresistenten, oft atypisch lokalisierten Ulcera herangezogen werden. Die Lokalisationsdiagnostik erfolgt etwa mit Octreotid-Szintigraphie, Positronenemissionstomographie, MRT, CT sowie endoluminalem Ultraschall. Metastasierte neuroendokrine Tumoren k\u00f6nnen mit palliativem Ansatz mit Y-DOTATOC oder Lu-DOTATOC behandelt werden.

Man geht von einer multifaktoriellen Genese aus mit genetischen, psychodynamischen und umweltbedingten Ursachen. Die psychopathologische Schule von Wernicke-Kleist-Leonhard sieht die Schizophrenien \u2013 auch die katatonen Formen \u2013 als heterogene Krankheitsgruppe. F\u00fcr die Unterform \u201eperiodische Katatonie\u201c nahm Karl Leonhard genetische Ursachen an. Mit dem Nachweis des Suszeptibilit\u00e4tsgens 15q15 gelang die Begr\u00fcndung einer genetischen Disposition f\u00fcr diese schubf\u00f6rmig verlaufenden Katatonie. Die chronischen Katatonien f\u00fchrte Leonhard auf maternale Infektionen im mittleren Schwangerschaftsdrittel zur\u00fcck. Im Krankheitsverlauf kann es zu den folgenden Symptomen kommen: - Mutismus - Katalepsie - Flexibilitas cerea - Negativismus - Befehlsautomatie - Echolalie - Raptus - Stupor - Manierismen - Ambitendenz - Verharren - Mitgehen - Proskinese Geht der Stupor mit Fieber einher, spricht man von einer febrilen, pernizi\u00f6sen, oder malignen Katatonie. Dieses vital bedrohliche Erscheinungsbild bot fr\u00fcher nur minimale \u00dcberlebenschancen. Dank der Therapiem\u00f6glichkeiten mit modernen Behandlungsmethoden (Intensivstation und -therapie, Benzodiazepine, Neuroleptika, Elektrokonvulsionstherapie) \u00fcberleben inzwischen fast alle betroffenen Patienten. Die Diskussion, ob die \"pernizi\u00f6se\" oder \"maligne\" Katatonie mit dem lebensbedrohlichen Krankheitsbild \"Malignes Neuroleptisches Syndrom\" (MNS) identisch ist, wurde bisher nicht abschlie\u00dfend gel\u00f6st. Der Krankheitsverlauf ist \u00e4hnlich, das Bild der t\u00f6dlichen Katatonie ist vor \u00fcber 100 Jahren erstbeschrieben, das Bild des MNS existiert dagegen erst seit Einf\u00fchrung der Neuroleptika in den 1960er Jahren. Katatone Zust\u00e4nde werden zun\u00e4chst meist mit Benzodiazepinen behandelt, um die Katalepsie zu durchbrechen und die dabei oft vorhandene starke Angst zu vermindern. Die Behandlung erfolgt weiterhin, wie bei den anderen schizophrenen Formen, mit Antipsychotika. In der Langzeitbehandlung k\u00f6nnen Stimmungsstabilisatoren wie Lithium, Valproins\u00e4ure, Carbamazepin und Lamotrigin \u00fcberaus hilfreich sein. Katatonie kann auch mittels Elektrokrampftherapie (EKT) oft rasch und wirkungsvoll behandelt werden. Basierend auf der GABA-Glutamat-Hypothese der Katatonie kann bei Versagen einer Therapie mit Benzodiazepinen wie Lorazepam auch ein Therapieversuch mit Dopaminagonisten oder Amantadin (einem NMDA-Rezeptor-Antagonisten) erwogen werden."}

Etwa ein Drittel der Erkrankungen treten im Rahmen einer Erstinfektion auf, in allen anderen F\u00e4llen handelt es sich um eine Reaktivierung des lebenslang in den Nervenzellganglien persistierenden Erregers. Die H\u00e4ufigkeit einer Herpes-simplex-Enzephalitis korreliert nicht mit h\u00e4ufigen Rezidiven eines Lippenherpes. Die Herpes-simplex-Viren erreichen das Gehirn am h\u00e4ufigsten durch axonalen Transport \u00fcber den Nervus olfactorius und infizieren \u00fcber den Tractus olfactorius frontale und temporale Hirnareale. Durch kontinuierliche und axonale Ausbreitung werden weitere Nervenzellen erreicht, die durch die Vermehrung des Virus zerst\u00f6rt werden. Betroffene Regionen sind dann das Limbische System, der Gyrus cinguli, Thalamus, die Stammganglien und schlie\u00dflich Pons, Mittelhirn und im Endstadium die Medulla oblongata. Selten kann die Infektionsausbreitung auch \u00fcber andere Hirnnerven erfolgen (Nervus trigeminus, Nervus abducens und Nervus vagus). Dabei kommt es zu einer raschen Ausbreitung im Rautenhirn und einer in wenigen Tagen t\u00f6dlich verlaufenden Rhombenzephalitis.

Ohne diese Fehlbildungen ist die Lebenserwartung fast wie \u00fcblich. 15 von 100 aller Elternpaare eines Kindes mit Fraser-Syndrom sind blutsverwandt. In den meisten F\u00e4llen erfordern die Kehlkopffehlbildungen eine Tracheotomie w\u00e4hrend oder unmittelbar nach der Geburt. Diese kann jedoch nach einigen Jahren, je nach Art der Fehlbildung, wieder verschlossen werden, sofern es m\u00f6glich ist, die Funktion des Kehlkopfes operativ wiederherzustellen. Das Fraser-Syndrom kann in der Schwangerschaft im Rahmen von Pr\u00e4nataldiagnostik mittels Ultraschall festgestellt werden. H\u00e4ufig f\u00e4llt es beim Feinultraschall auf, sofern z. B. die Symptome Syndaktylie und echogene Lungen vorhanden sind."}

Deren Umfang und Intensit\u00e4t kann sich von Fall zu Fall unterscheiden und bis hin zu schwerer Behinderung f\u00fchren. Bei chronischem Verlauf bestehen die Symptome dauernd oder mit zwischenzeitlicher Unterbrechung. H\u00e4ufig berichtet werden: - Algurie (Schmerzen und Brennen beim Wasserlassen), - Pollakisurie (h\u00e4ufiger Harndrang), - Harnabflussst\u00f6rungen, - Schmerzen in der Penis-, Hoden-, Damm-, Anal-, Leisten-, Scham- sowie in der Lendengegend, - Schmerzen w\u00e4hrend und insbesondere nach der Ejakulation. Derzeit sind nur wenige Erhebungen zur Epidemiologie dokumentiert, diese zeigen aber bereits eine gro\u00dfe klinische und gesundheitspolitische Bedeutung auf. Die H\u00e4ufigkeit des Prostatitissyndroms liegt demnach bei etwa 2 bis 10 % der m\u00e4nnlichen Bev\u00f6lkerung. Wegen Prostatitis suchen in den USA mehr M\u00e4nner den Arzt auf als wegen BPH oder Prostatakarzinom. Die Beschwerden treten meist als komplexe Symptomatik auf, unter der viele M\u00e4nner chronisch \u00fcber l\u00e4ngeren Zeitraum leiden. Der Beschwerdedruck ist oft dem bei Angina pectoris, aktivem Morbus Crohn oder dem Zustand nach Herzinfarkt vergleichbar. Eindeutige Marker f\u00fcr die Diagnose des Prostatitissyndroms existieren nicht. Zur Basisdiagnostik geh\u00f6ren Anamneseerhebung, digital-rektale Abtastung (Palpation) der Prostata, Entz\u00fcndungs- und Erregerlokalisation mittels 4-Gl\u00e4ser-Probe (Ersturin, Mittelstrahlurin, Prostataexprimat und Urin nach Prostatamassage), Ejakulatanalyse zur Entz\u00fcndungsbestimmung, Sonographie, Uroflowmetrie mit Restharnmessung zur Bestimmung funktioneller oder anatomischer Harnabflussst\u00f6rungen, orientierend neurologische Untersuchung. Zur Symptomevaluierung werden unterst\u00fctzend standardisierte Fragenb\u00f6gen (Symptome Scores) herangezogen. Anstatt der aufwendigen 4-Gl\u00e4ser-Probe wird im klinischen Alltag oft eine \u00e4hnlich zuverl\u00e4ssige vergleichende Untersuchung von Urin vor und nach Prostatamassage eingesetzt. Unter Schirmherrschaft der National Institutes of Health (NIH) wurde eine Klassifizierung der Prostatitisformen erarbeitet, die in der Prostatitisforschung und zunehmend auch in der urologischen Praxis angewendet wird. - akute Prostatitis (Kategorie I) - chronische bakterielle Prostatitis (Kategorie II) - chronische abakterielle Prostatitis/ chronisches Schmerzsyndrom des Beckens; kurz CP/CPPS (Kategorie III) - asymptomatische entz\u00fcndliche Prostatitis (Kategorie IV). Bei der akuten Prostatitis handelt es sich um eine akute Infektion der Prostata, die von Fieber, Sch\u00fcttelfrost und Harnverhalt begleitet sein kann. Als Erreger gelten insbesondere Bakterien der im Darm siedelnden Art Escherichia coli. Diese sind massenhaft im Urin nachweisbar. Die Leukozyten- und oft auch die Konzentration des prostataspezifischen Antigens sind erh\u00f6ht. Die \u00e4tiologische Bedeutung von Chlamydien- und Mykoplasmenspezies ist umstritten."}

Man hoffte, dort riesige Mengen von Bodensch\u00e4tzen zu heben. In ganz Peru und Chile wurden Arbeiter angeworben, um den Bahnbau zu unterst\u00fctzen. Im Jahre 1869 verlie\u00df die Strecke das Tiefland und erreichte entlang des Rimac-Flusses H\u00f6hen von \u00fcber 1000 m. Zu der Strecke geh\u00f6rte auch die Verrugas-Br\u00fccke.

Die Arbeiter litten zuerst an hohem Fieber, bevor Tausende von ihnen an schweren An\u00e4mien (Blutarmut) und aufgrund von Sekund\u00e4rinfektionen wie Miliartuberkulose, Shigellosen und Salmonellosen verstarben. Die Krankheit war in dieser Region jedoch alles andere als neu. Schon im Jahre 1540 berichtete Valdizan, der Milit\u00e4rberichterstatter von Francisco Pizarro, von einem Ausbruch einer Krankheit unter den Soldaten, die mit hohem Fieber begann und den \u00dcberlebenden nach einiger Zeit blutgef\u00fcllte Warzen entstehen lie\u00df.

Jedoch zierten die Warzen nicht nur bildhafte Darstellungen von Menschen auf T\u00f6pfereien und Stelen, sondern sogar pr\u00e4kolumbische Mumien.

F\u00e4llt der Partialdruck des Sauerstoffs unter eine individuelle Grenze, wird der Mensch ohnm\u00e4chtig. W\u00e4hrend eines nur vor\u00fcbergehenden Atemstillstands, einer Apnoe, steigt der CO-Partialdruck im Blut deutlich an, so dass vor dem Eintreten einer Ohnmacht eine sog. Weckreaktion ausgel\u00f6st wird. Man unterscheidet obstruktive und zentrale Apnoen. Kommen bei einem Patienten beide Formen vor, spricht man von gemischten Apnoesyndromen. Die weitaus h\u00e4ufigste, bei etwa 5-10 % der Bev\u00f6lkerung vorkommende Form ist das obstruktive Schlafapnoe-Syndrom (OSAS). Die direkte Ursache des OSAS ist eine starke Entspannung der ringf\u00f6rmigen Muskulatur um die oberen Atemwege im Schlaf. Dadurch sind der Nasen- bzw. der Mundrachen nicht mehr in der Lage, dem beim Einatmen in Lunge und Bronchien entstehenden Unterdruck genug Widerstand entgegenzusetzen. Der obere Teil der Atemwege f\u00e4llt zusammen und es kommt zu einer Behinderung (Obstruktion) ebendieser. Krankhafte Atemstillst\u00e4nde dauern l\u00e4nger als zehn Sekunden, wodurch die arterielle Sauerstoffs\u00e4ttigung bzw. der Sauerstoffgehalt des Blutes abf\u00e4llt (Hypox\u00e4mie). Dies f\u00fchrt erstens zu einer Mangelversorgung der Gewebe im K\u00f6rper und im Gehirn und zweitens zu einem erh\u00f6hten CO-Spiegel im Blut. In Folge der frustranen Einatmungsbewegung (M\u00fcller-Man\u00f6ver) und des ansteigenden CO-Spiegels kommt es zu einer Weckreaktion des K\u00f6rpers (\u201emicro-arousal\u201c), aufgrund derer die Atmung dann wieder einsetzt. Meist erinnert der Patient sich nicht an diese Reaktion. Die physiologische Struktur des Schlafs wird zerst\u00f6rt und die Erholungsfunktion behindert. F\u00e4llt der obere Teil der Atemwege nur teilweise zusammen, kommt es zu einer kurzzeitigen Reduzierung des Atemvolumens, den so genannten Hypopnoen. Auch dabei sinkt letztlich der Sauerstoffgehalt im Blut, aber nicht so stark wie bei Apnoen."}

Bis in die zweite H\u00e4lfte des 19. Jahrhunderts wurde sie als \u201eNebendr\u00fcse der Respirationsorgane\u201c betrachtet, deren Funktion unklar war. 1896 fand Eugen Baumann organisch gebundenes Jod in der Schilddr\u00fcse, das sogenannte Jodothyrin (oder auch Thyreojodin) und charakterisierte es als den wirksamen Bestandteil der Schilddr\u00fcse. \u00dcber seine Wirkung war jedoch noch 1898 kaum etwas bekannt (Robert Hutchison); es diente bis ins 20. Jahrhundert zu Versuchzwecken. 1911 beschrieb Harry E. Alderson die Entstehung des Myx\u00f6dems bei Hypothyreose als subkutane Infiltration einer schleim\u00e4hnlichen Substanz, die im weiteren Verlauf durch eine \u00fcberschie\u00dfende Bildung von Bindegewebe ersetzt wird. Zus\u00e4tzlich fand er, dass die Ichthyose damit einhergeht und setzte erfolgreich Schilddr\u00fcsenextrakte und Jodothyrin zur Therapie ein. Die Entdeckung des Schilddr\u00fcsenhormones Thyroxin wird Edward Calvin Kendall 1914 zugeschrieben. Er hatte aus Jodothyrin einen aktiven Anteil herauskristallisiert und ihn Thyroxin genannt. Als beste M\u00f6glichkeit zur Feststellung einer Hypothyreose mittels Untersuchung des Blutes werden in dieser Zeit als Parameter eine beschleunigte Blutgerinnung sowie eine Abnahme der Neutrophilen und eine Zunahme der Lymphozyten erachtet. Die direkte Messung vom Thyroxin im Blut ist seit den 1960er Jahren m\u00f6glich. Beim gesunden Menschen gibt die Schilddr\u00fcse bedarfsgerecht die Schilddr\u00fcsenhormone \u2013 Thyroxin (T) und Trijodthyronin (T) \u2013 ins Blut ab. Die Produktion dieser Hormone wird durch den thyreotropen Regelkreis gesteuert. In der Schilddr\u00fcse bewirkt eine Verminderung des in der Hirnanhangsdr\u00fcse (Hypophyse) gebildeten Hormons Thyreotropin (TSH) eine Verminderung der Produktion von Schilddr\u00fcsenhormonen. Zum Aufbau von Thyroxin und Trijodthyronin ben\u00f6tigt die Schilddr\u00fcse Jod. Der Bedarf des Erwachsenen liegt bei etwa 200 \u03bcg pro Tag. Eine ausreichende Zufuhr mit der normalen Ern\u00e4hrung ist in Deutschland nicht immer gew\u00e4hrleistet.

Auch andere Anomalien wie die Dorsalkurvatur des Penis oder eine dorsal gespaltene Vorhaut k\u00f6nnen mit einer Epispadie assoziiert auftreten. Mit einer Epispadia pubis ist typischerweise auch eine Harninkontinenz verbunden, weil auch der Blasenschlie\u00dfmuskel (und ggf. auch die Symphyse) nicht zusammengewachsen, also gespalten sind. Beim Vorliegen einer Epispadie werden erg\u00e4nzend diagnostisch Sonographie und Ausscheidungsurogramm als Basisdiagnostik empfohlen. In der Regel stehen hier, im Gegensatz zur Hypospadie weniger die kosmetischen Aspekte im Vordergrund, sondern eher die funktionellen wie Inkontinenz (bei hochgradigen), Schmerzen bei der Erektion und eine Impotentia coeundi aufgrund einer Verk\u00fcrzung der pars pendulans des Penis. Auch psychische St\u00f6rungen sind oft damit verbunden. Zur Korrektur der Fehlbildung sind operative Penis- und Harnr\u00f6hrenplastiken im 1. -4. Lebensjahr m\u00f6glich.

Das Kammerwasser (Humor aquosus) ist eine klare K\u00f6rperfl\u00fcssigkeit in der vorderen und hinteren Augenkammer. Es wird im Ziliark\u00f6rper des Auges produziert und an die hintere Augenkammer abgegeben. Durch die Pupille gelangt es in die vordere Augenkammer und flie\u00dft im Kammerwinkel durch das Trabekelwerk und den Schlemm-Kanal ab. Durch das so gegebene Verh\u00e4ltnis von Kammerwasserproduktion zu Kammerwasserabfluss, der durch den Widerstand des Trabekelwerkes reguliert wird, entsteht der Augeninnendruck. Der normale Augeninnendruck liegt zwischen 10 und 21 mm Hg. Schwankungen im Tagesverlauf um bis zu 5 mm Hg gelten als physiologisch, wobei die h\u00f6chsten Werte in der Regel nachts oder in den fr\u00fchen Morgenstunden auftreten. \u00c4ltere Menschen haben einen durchschnittlich h\u00f6heren Augeninnendruck als j\u00fcngere.

Auch in nichtkommerziellen Kontexten kann dies genutzt werden, wenn etwa der eigene Partner durch kunstvolles Entkleiden stimuliert werden soll. Eine gewisse Lust am Betrachten anderer Personen in sexuellen Kontexten kann als v\u00f6llig normal erachtet werden: Nach einer kanadischen Studie betrachten 70 % der M\u00e4nner und 40 % der Frauen gern andere beim Sex. Die sexuelle Erregung beim \u201eSpannen\u201c wird hierbei durch das heimliche Betrachten der Geschlechtsorgane und/oder des Ges\u00e4\u00dfes und durch den Reiz des heimlichen Tabubruches gesteigert und \u2013 falls Gelegenheit besteht \u2013 gleichzeitig durch Masturbation zum Orgasmus gebracht, anderenfalls m\u00f6glichst bald danach. Die Suche nach einer passenden Gelegenheit wird als spannend empfunden, was zur Luststeigerung beitr\u00e4gt. Voyeure suchen gezielt nach Orten, an denen Menschen sich unbek\u00fcmmert ausziehen. Bei Voyeuren beliebt sind alle Situationen, in welchen sich Menschen unbekleidet oder nur knapp bekleidet zeigen, beispielsweise Str\u00e4nde oder Badeseen, FKK-Gebiete, Umkleidekabinen, \u00f6ffentliche Toiletten, Saunen und Sent\u014ds oder Fenster, durch die sie bei Einbruch der Dunkelheit und eingeschalteter Zimmerbeleuchtung ihre Opfer beobachten.

Voyeure wenden viel Phantasie auf, um mit unterschiedlichen Hilfsmitteln Sichtschutzma\u00dfnahmen zu unterlaufen, ihr Verhalten zu tarnen und unerkannt zu bleiben. Die \u00fcblichen von Voyeuren benutzten Hilfsmittel sind Ferngl\u00e4ser und Fernrohre.

Als Therapie wird eine chirurgische Entfernung des Aspergilloms unter Schonung der Schleimhaut der Kieferh\u00f6hle vorgenommen. Diese wird nach M\u00f6glichkeit endoskopisch durch die Nase vorgenommen. Das Aspergillom zeigt sich als gr\u00fcnlich-schwarzer Stein, der aus nekrotischen Pilzmassen und aus verstoffwechseltem Calcium besteht. Langzeitfolgen sind nicht zu erwarten.

Nahezu alle malignen Tumoren, die aus solchen mesenchymalen Geweben entstanden sind, werden als Sarkome bezeichnet. Das Leiomyosarkom metastasiert vorwiegend auf dem Blutweg. W\u00e4hrend fr\u00fcher vermutet wurde, dass das Leiomyosarkom aus einem gutartigen Leiomyom entarten kann, zeigen aktuelle Studien, dass dies unwahrscheinlich ist. Ebenso gibt es keine Hinweise darauf, dass vorausgehende Bestrahlung einen Risikofaktor darstellt. Selten treten Leiomyosarkome im Rahmen eines heredit\u00e4ren Retinoblastoms auf, auch finden sich bei wenigen Tumoren Ver\u00e4nderungen im RB-Tumorsuppressorgen. Aufgrund der unspezifischen Symptome ist die Diagnose meist ein Zufallsbefund, wenn aus anderen Gr\u00fcnden eine Operation notwendig war. Das Leiomyosarkom ist im Operationspr\u00e4parat normalerweise nicht vom Leiomyom zu unterscheiden, gegebenenfalls auftretende Nekrosen k\u00f6nnen einen Hinweis auf die Dignit\u00e4t liefern. Weiterhin sind Infiltrationen in das umliegende Gewebe wie z. B. bei Lokalisation in der Geb\u00e4rmutter in das Myometrium, Endometrium oder Parametrium malignomverd\u00e4chtig. In der Histologie finden sich vielgestaltige Zellkerne und Riesenzellen. Das relevanteste Kriterium f\u00fcr die Diagnose des Leiomyosarkoms bleibt der Mitosereichtum (mehr als 10 Mitosen in 10 Gesichtsfeldern bei 400facher Vergr\u00f6\u00dferung) und gleichzeitig vorkommender Vielgestaltigkeit der Zellen (Zellpolymorphie). Da das Leiomyosarkom nicht ausreichend auf Chemotherapie und die Strahlentherapie anspricht, steht die Operation im Mittelpunkt der Therapie. Es existieren gegenw\u00e4rtig keine verbindlichen Standards, da das Leiomyosarkom einerseits zu der heterogenen Gruppe der Sarkome geh\u00f6rt und andererseits sein Auftreten sehr selten ist. In etwa 30 % der F\u00e4lle werden bei Lokalisation in der Geb\u00e4rmutter Metastasen in den Eierst\u00f6cken gefunden, daher ist die Mitentfernung der Eierst\u00f6cke angebracht (Ovariohysterektomie). Bei 3 bis 5 % der diagnostizierten Leiomyosarkome finden sich auch Metastasen im gro\u00dfen Netz. Bei 4 bis 35 % der Betroffenen finden sich befallene Lymphknoten im Becken und neben der Hauptschlagader. Eine Entfernung dieser Lymphknoten scheint jedoch keine Lebensverl\u00e4ngerung mit sich zu bringen."}

Die Wechsel sind eher flie\u00dfend als pl\u00f6tzlich, und die Betroffenen nehmen sie in der Regel lange Zeit nicht als Wechsel, sondern als unklare St\u00f6rungen wahr.

Da bei dieser Erkrankung die Bakterien selbst auf den Darmtrakt beschr\u00e4nkt bleiben und weder die Basalmembran des Darmepithels \u00fcberschreiten noch in die Blutbahn gelangen, spricht man strenggenommen nicht von einer Infektion, sondern von einer bakteriellen Intoxikation. HUS trat auch in Zusammenhang mit Virusinfektionen, insbesondere mit Grippe, auf. Das atypische HUS hat seine Ursache in Knochenmarkstransplantationen oder immunsuppressiver Medikation nach Transplantationen, bei Schwangerschaft, Krebs, Chemotherapie und HIV. Auch genetische Faktoren spielen eine Rolle. Beim typischen HUS binden sich Toxine an spezifische Rezeptoren des glomerul\u00e4ren Endothels, was zum Tod dieser Zellen f\u00fchrt. Durch die darauf folgenden Gerinnungsprozesse werden Blutgerinnsel eingeschwemmt, die zum Verschluss der glomerul\u00e4ren Mikrokapillare f\u00fchren. Bei den durch EHEC verursachten Verlaufsformen binden die Bakterien an Oberfl\u00e4chenmolek\u00fcle von Darmepithelien. Diese Bindung wird durch ein im Bakteriengenom codiertes Protein vermittelt. Dieses zu den Adh\u00e4sinen geh\u00f6rende Protein wird auf dem chromosomalen Gen eae lokalisiert. Da bei Kindern und S\u00e4uglingen die Anzahl dieser Rezeptoren auf den Zellen h\u00f6her als bei Erwachsenen ist, sind diese auch anf\u00e4lliger f\u00fcr diese klassische Verlaufsform des HUS. Nach der Anheftung produzieren die EHEC-Bakterien ein zellzerst\u00f6rendes Toxin (Verotoxin oder auch Shiga-like Toxin STX2 genannt), das zun\u00e4chst lokal die Darmepithelzellen zerst\u00f6rt und dadurch eine Durchfallerkrankung ausl\u00f6st."}

Hervorstechende Merkmale sind ein hufeisenf\u00f6rmiger Gro\u00dfkern und ein runder Kleinkern. Der Parasit lebt in der Epidermis beziehungsweise im Epithel der Kiemen seines Wirtes in nach au\u00dfen abgeschlossenen H\u00f6hlungen. Ist er zur Fortpflanzungsf\u00e4higkeit herangereift, durchbricht er die Haut und verl\u00e4sst den Wirt, wodurch dieser erhebliche Hautverletzungen erleidet. Im Wasser sinkt Ichthyophthirius multifiliis zu Boden, setzt sich dort fest und beginnt mit der Bildung von Zysten. In diesen finden wiederholte Teilungen in bis zu 1000 so genannte Schw\u00e4rmer (Tomiten) von 50 bis 70 Mikrometer Gr\u00f6\u00dfe statt. Die Schw\u00e4rmer sind wieder f\u00fcr Fische invasionsf\u00e4hig, m\u00fcssen aber innerhalb von 70 Stunden einen Wirt finden. Die Dauer des Vermehrungsprozesses ist temperaturabh\u00e4ngig, bei vier Grad Celsius dauert er etwa sechs Tage, bei 25 bis 28 Grad Celsius nur zehn bis zw\u00f6lf Stunden. Besonders in tropischen Aquarien kann es deshalb zu einer explosionsartigen Vermehrung mit entsprechenden Befallsraten kommen. Befallene Fische haben bis stecknadelkopfgro\u00dfe, wei\u00dfe Kn\u00f6tchen am ganzen K\u00f6rper, den Flossen und den Kiemen. In schweren F\u00e4llen k\u00f6nnen sich die Kn\u00f6tchen zu grauen Fl\u00e4chen vereinen. Die betroffenen Fische zeigen h\u00e4ufig Atemnot, \u201eFlossenklemmen\u201c und heftige Scheuerbewegungen. In der Folge wird der Fisch zunehmend apathisch und magert ab. W\u00e4hrend seiner Wachstumsphase in der Haut des Wirtes ist der Parasit nicht direkt zu bek\u00e4mpfen. Die Behandlung richtet sich also gegen die frei schwimmenden Schw\u00e4rmer. In Aquarien kann unterst\u00fctzend die Wassertemperatur leicht erh\u00f6ht werden, um die gesch\u00fctzte Entwicklungsphase als Zyste zu verk\u00fcrzen. Als Medikament f\u00fcr Zierfische eignet sich Malachitgr\u00fcn, Nutzfische k\u00f6nnen mit Formalin und Kaliumpermanganat behandelt werden.

Experimentell konnte er nach Applikation eines \u201eSensitizers\u201c (Selye verabreichte Parathormon oder Dihydrotachysterin) eine hyperkalz\u00e4mische Stoffwechsellage in Ratten induzieren. Durch eine zeitlich nachfolgende Verabreichung eines \u201eChallengers\u201c (mechanisch oder chemisch) lassen sich Verkalkungen ausl\u00f6sen. Abh\u00e4ngig vom Challenger lassen sich die betroffenen Gewebe einer Verkalkung voraussagen. Einer Kalziphylaxie liegt in den meisten F\u00e4llen eine schwere Erkrankung der Nieren (Nephropathie) mit Funktionseinschr\u00e4nkung (Niereninsuffizienz) zugrunde. Die Nephropathie f\u00fchrt zu einer St\u00f6rung der Kalzium- und Phosphatausscheidung der Niere. Das von der gesunden Niere gebildete Calcitriol wird nicht mehr in ausreichenden Mengen gebildet. Damit sinkt der hemmende Einfluss des Calcitriols auf die Produktion des Parathormons (PTH) in der Nebenschilddr\u00fcse, so dass eine verst\u00e4rkte Produktion von Parathormon stattfindet (sekund\u00e4rer Hyperparathyreoidismus). Durch die verst\u00e4rkte Wirkung des Parathormons entsteht eine unnat\u00fcrlich hohe Phosphat-Konzentration im Serum (Hyperphosphat\u00e4mie) und eine unnat\u00fcrlich niedrige Kalzium-Konzentration im Serum (Hypokalzi\u00e4mie). Diese erh\u00f6hten Phosphat-Mengen im Serum stammen aus den Kalzium-Phosphat-Salzen des Knochens. Durch die Wirkung des Parathormons wird vermehrt Phosphat ausgeschieden, was zu einem weiteren Abbau der Knochensubstanz bei gleichzeitigem Fehlen oder verminderter Menge von Calcitriol verst\u00e4rkt wird. Es resultiert eine Ausd\u00fcnnung der Knochensubstanz (renale Osteodystrophie), vergleichbar mit der Osteoporose. Bei unver\u00e4ndertem Fortschreiten dieser Prozesse (beispielsweise bei unzureichender Therapie) kommt es zu einem weiteren Anstieg des Phosphats im Serum. Durch zus\u00e4tzliche Einfl\u00fcsse wie die Ans\u00e4uerung des Blutes (Azidose) kommt es zu einer Beg\u00fcnstigung der Kalzium-Phosphat-Salzbildung an nicht-nat\u00fcrlichen Stellen wie beispielsweise den Gef\u00e4\u00dfw\u00e4nden der kleinen Arterien (Arteriolen) oder des Unterhautfettgewebes. Die dort entstandenen Salze wirken auf das Gewebe und die Zellen sch\u00e4dlich, bei zunehmender Menge auch t\u00f6dlich, sodass das betroffene Gewebe abstirbt (Nekrose). Alternativ kann die Einlagerung von Salzen insbesondere in den kleinen Arterien im Zusammenspiel mit der Einlagerung von Fett zu kritischen Gef\u00e4\u00dfengp\u00e4ssen oder Verschl\u00fcssen mit nachfolgender Durchblutungsst\u00f6rung f\u00fchren. In seltenen F\u00e4llen kann eine Kalziphylaxie auch auftreten, wenn keine Nierenerkrankung besteht. Als zugrunde liegende Erkrankungen werden angegeben: Prim\u00e4rer Hyperparathyreoidismus, Krebserkrankungen, alkoholische Leberzirrhose, Kollagenosen, Therapie mit Glucocorticoiden, Warfarin, Protein-C-Mangel und Protein-S-Mangel.

Personen, die Zoophilie praktizieren, werden als \u201eZoophile\u201c, \u201eZoosexuelle\u201c oder einfach als \u201eZoos\u201c bezeichnet. Zooerastie oder Sodomie sind seltener verwendete Begriffe. \u201eBestiosexualit\u00e4t\u201c wurde kurz diskutiert, hat sich aber nie etabliert. Der Begriff \u201eZoophilie\u201c wurde in das Feld der Sexualit\u00e4tsforschung in Psychopathia sexualis (1886) von Krafft-Ebing eingef\u00fchrt, der eine Anzahl seiner F\u00e4lle als \u201eMissbrauch von Tieren (Bestialit\u00e4t)\u201c bezeichnete, und als \u201eZoophilia erotica\u201c, welche er als sexuelle Affinit\u00e4t f\u00fcr tierisches Fell oder Haut definierte. Im \u00fcblichen heutigen Gebrauch bezieht sich der Begriff \u201eZoophilie\u201c auf sexuelle Aktivit\u00e4t zwischen Menschen und nicht-menschlichen Tieren, auf das Verlangen nach solcher Aktivit\u00e4t oder auf die spezifische Paraphilie (Paraphilie, sprich, die atypische Erregung), welche eine eindeutige Pr\u00e4ferenz von nicht-menschlichen Tieren \u00fcber Menschen als Sexualpartner anzeigt. Zoophile betonen die soziale Komponente dieser Bindung. Obwohl Krafft-Ebing auch den Begriff \u201eZooerastie\u201c f\u00fcr die exklusiv auf nicht-menschliche Tiere gerichtete Affinit\u00e4t gepr\u00e4gt hat, wird der Begriff gew\u00f6hnlich nicht mehr verwendet.

Beide Auspr\u00e4gungen des Blasenekstrophie-Epispadie-Komplexes sind weniger h\u00e4ufig als die Blasenekstrophie selbst. Die Behandlung besteht in einer chirurgischen Korrektur des Defektes.

Wenn dies nicht zum erwarteten Erfolg f\u00fchrt, muss \u00fcber einen \u201ek\u00fcnstlichen\u201c Blasenersatz nachgedacht werden, um die Nierenfunktion nicht zu gef\u00e4hrden und eine ausreichende Harnkontinenz zu gew\u00e4hrleisten. Dabei wird ein Harnreservoir zumeist aus einem St\u00fcck Darm, welches zuvor vom restlichen Darm abgeteilt wurde, gebildet. Dieses Reservoir kann dann \u00fcber verschiedene Wege entleert werden. In einem oftmals sp\u00e4teren Eingriff sollte eine kosmetische Korrektur des \u00e4u\u00dferen Genitals vorgenommen werden. Ziel jeder Therapie sollte sein, die Nierenfunktion, welche von Geburt an durch die Fehlbildung nicht beeintr\u00e4chtigt ist, zu erhalten und gleichzeitig eine ausreichende Harnkontrolle und -kontinenz zu gew\u00e4hrleisten. Die Verbesserung der sexuellen Funktionalit\u00e4t spielt ebenfalls eine wichtige Rolle. Die von Karel Maydl (1853\u20131903) 1892 eingef\u00fchrte transtrigonale Ureterosigmoideostomie konnte erstmals die Problematik der Harninkontinenz beheben. Die operative Therapie der Harnblasenekstrophie geh\u00f6rt in die H\u00e4nde von Zentren mit ausreichender Erfahrung des seltenen Krankheitsbildes. Bei nicht erfolgreicher Operation drohen eine lebenslange Inkontinenz, eine fehlende Harnblasenkapazit\u00e4t und sexuelle Dysfunktion. Auch bei erfolgreicher operativer Behandlung k\u00f6nnen die Patienten eventuell mit folgenden Langzeitproblemen konfrontiert sein: - Harninkontinenz - Harnr\u00fcckstau in die Niere - wiederkehrende Entz\u00fcndungen des Urogenitaltraktes - sexueller Dysfunktion."}

Als bakterielle Infektionskrankheit wird hingegen die direkte Sch\u00e4digung des Wirtes durch den Erreger und die darauf folgenden Abwehrreaktionen des Wirtes bei einer Infektion definiert. Eine krankhafte, selbstsch\u00e4digende Abwehrreaktionen des Wirtes nach einer bakteriellen Infektion, also nach der Elimination des Erregers, wird nicht als bakterielle Infektionskrankheit angesprochen, obwohl die Ursache in der urspr\u00fcnglichen Infektion liegt. Diese Folgeerkrankungen bezeichnet man als post- oder parainfekti\u00f6se Syndrome. Vermehrt sich das Bakterium, dringt jedoch wie beispielsweise bei den meisten Bakterien auf der Haut oder in der Mundh\u00f6hle nicht in das Gewebe ein, so spricht man von bakterieller Besiedelung. Dies gilt auch f\u00fcr Bakterien, die als Kommensalen oder Symbionten im Magen-Darm-Trakt als sogenannte Darmflora vorkommen, da der Magen-Darm-Trakt anatomisch als \u201eau\u00dfen\u201c betrachtet wird. Gelangen bei einer solchen Besiedelung sch\u00e4digende bakterielle Stoffwechselprodukte (Exotoxine) in den Wirt, so ist dies eine bakterielle Intoxikation. Umgangssprachlich werden akute bakterielle Infektionskrankheiten der Atemwege auch verk\u00fcrzt als bakterielle Infekte bezeichnet. Eine Infektionskrankheit entsteht durch die krankheitsausl\u00f6senden Eigenschaften eines Erregers und den Reaktionen des Wirtes auf das Eindringen und Vermehren des Erregers. Dabei verursacht ein Erreger nicht in jedem Fall eine Erkrankung, vielmehr sind Verlauf und Symptome einer bakteriellen Infektionskrankheit das Ergebnis eines sehr komplexen und dynamischen Zusammenspiels zwischen Wirt und Erreger. Im Verlauf der Jahrmillionen andauernden Koevolution von beiden entwickelten Wirtsorganismen immer spezifischere Abwehrmechanismen, beginnend mit der einfachen Phagozytose des Erregers (Aufnahme in die Zelle und Zerst\u00f6rung durch intrazellul\u00e4ren Verdau), mechanische und enzymatische Barrieren, Entwicklung eines unspezifischen Abwehrsystems mithilfe von Plasmaproteinen (Komplementsystem), bis hin zum spezifischen zellul\u00e4ren System der T-Lymphozyten und nicht-zellul\u00e4rer (humoraler), spezifischer Antik\u00f6rper. Die bakteriellen Erreger ihrerseits entwickelten immer neue molekulare und biochemische Mechanismen, um diese einzelnen Abwehrbarrieren zu unterlaufen. Aufgrund der sehr kurzen Generationszeit von Bakterien im Vergleich zu den Wirtsorganismen (20 Minuten bis wenige Stunden im Vergleich zu mehreren Jahren), k\u00f6nnen bakterielle Erreger sehr viel schneller Varianten hervorbringen und auf neue Abwehrmechanismen reagieren. Diese evolution\u00e4ren Mechanismen spielen nicht nur in der stammesgeschichtlichen Evolution eine Rolle, sondern auch im Einzelnen Wirtsorganismus im Verlauf einer Infektion. Solch eine schnelle Mikroevolution der Bakterienpopulation ist auch ein Grund f\u00fcr die Entstehung von Resistenzen gegen antibakterielle Therapien. Die ersten Schritte zur Infektion sind das Anhaften und der Eintritt der bakteriellen Erreger in den Wirtsorganismus. Der Eintritt wird durch anatomische Barrieren wie die intakte Haut verhindert, daher k\u00f6nnen Verletzungen der Haut beispielsweise durch Schnittwunden, Verbrennungen oder medizinische Eingriffe zu Eintrittspforten werden. Hautanhangsgebilde wie Haarfollikel, Talgdr\u00fcsen oder Schwei\u00dfdr\u00fcsen sind Orte, die bereits anatomisch Einsenkungen in die Haut bilden und damit Stellen mit geringerer Abwehr bilden (Locus minoris resistentiae) und dadurch bevorzugte Eintrittstellen darstellen. Die Anhaftung von Bakterien an Oberfl\u00e4chengewebe des Wirtes wird sehr effektiv durch die Abschilferung der obersten Schichten (Haut, Schleimhaut) und durch Wegschwemmen erschwert. Letzteres wird beispielsweise durch einen korrekten Urinabfluss im Harnleiter, intakten Tr\u00e4nenfluss und Lidschlag, ausreichenden Schleimtransport durch das Flimmerepithel der Luftr\u00f6hre oder eine regelrechte Darmbewegung erm\u00f6glicht."}

Einige Untersuchungen zeigten zudem eine erh\u00f6hte H\u00e4ufigkeit in Schwangerschaften mit weiblichen Feten.

Auch Schwangere mit einem Alter von mehr als 35 Jahren haben ein erh\u00f6htes Risiko f\u00fcr Plazentaimplantationsst\u00f6rungen. Man unterscheidet nach der Tiefe ihrer Verwachsung mit der Geb\u00e4rmutterwand drei Formen der Placenta accreta: Die Placenta accreta wird nur selten vor der Geburt erkannt und ist zuweilen schwer zu diagnostizieren. In der Doppler-Sonografie lassen sich neugebildete Blutgef\u00e4\u00dfe in der Muskulatur der Geb\u00e4rmutter nachweisen. Auch in der Magnetresonanztomographie (MRT) kann man Hinweise auf eine Plazentaimplantationsst\u00f6rung finden.

Im zweiten Schwangerschaftsdrittel lassen sich erh\u00f6hte Alpha-1-Fetoprotein-Werte im m\u00fctterlichen Blutserum nachweisen, die jedoch auch Indikatoren f\u00fcr viele andere Dinge sind. Im dritten Trimester treten bei Plazentationsst\u00f6rungen in einigen F\u00e4llen vaginale Blutungen auf, deren Ursache jedoch selten die St\u00f6rung selbst ist. Kommt es nicht innerhalb von 30 Minuten nach der Geburt des Kindes zur Geburt von Mutterkuchen und Eih\u00fcllen, muss man eine Placenta accreta in die Differentialdiagnostik einbeziehen. Wird eine Placenta accreta vor der Geburt diagnostiziert ist eine geplante Schnittentbindung, ggf. mit Geb\u00e4rmutterentfernung, der sicherste Geburtsmodus. Bei der manuellen Plazental\u00f6sung wegen Plazentaretention kann es zu erheblichen Blutungen kommen. Eine vollst\u00e4ndige L\u00f6sung des Mutterkuchens gelingt jedoch nur bei der Placenta adhaerens und der leichtesten Form der Placenta accreta.

Die Gef\u00e4\u00dfe des Lungenkreislaufs sind f\u00fcr einen so hohen Druck nicht ausgelegt und reagieren mit einer Mediahypertrophie, also einer Verdickung der Muskeln in der Wand der Arterien.

Durch verschiedene Regulationsmechanismen wird der Blutzuckerspiegel dort bei Gesunden langfristig bei etwa 70 bis 80 mg/dl konstant gehalten. Steigt nun infolge einer kohlenhydratreichen Nahrungszufuhr der Glukosespiegel im enterohepatischen Kreislauf, werden die Betazellen der Bauchspeicheldr\u00fcse angeregt, das blutzuckersenkende Hormon Insulin auszusch\u00fctten, um so den Glukosespiegel im Blut konstant zu halten. Versagt diese Regulation oder verliert das Insulin seine Wirkung, kommt es zu kurz- oder langfristiger Hyperglyk\u00e4mie. Die Hyperglyk\u00e4mie ist das Leitsymptom f\u00fcr einen Diabetes mellitus, ist f\u00fcr diesen allerdings kein sicheres Kriterium. Denn auch ein Morbus Cushing (erh\u00f6hter Cortisonspiegel), eine Akromegalie (erh\u00f6hter Wachstumshormonspiegel), ein Ph\u00e4ochromozytom (erh\u00f6hte Spiegel von Adrenalin und Noradrenalin), eine Hyperthyreose (beispielsweise infolge eines Morbus Basedow), Eisenablagerungen in den Betazellen des Pankreas (H\u00e4mochromatose) und Medikamente k\u00f6nnen sie ausl\u00f6sen. Sie kann ebenso bei Infekten, nach Herzinfarkt, Schlaganfall oder Narkosen auftreten. Bei H\u00fcndinnen kann es aufgrund hoher Progesteron-Spiegel in der Zwischenbrunst zu einem Blutzuckeranstieg im Blut kommen, bei Katzen kann Stress eine langanhaltende Hyperglyk\u00e4mie ausl\u00f6sen. Es gibt unterschiedliche Gr\u00fcnde, warum der K\u00f6rper den Blutzuckerspiegel nicht im physiologischen Bereich stabilisieren kann. Die h\u00e4ufigsten Ursachen f\u00fcr eine Erh\u00f6hung des Blutzuckerspiegels sind ein vermindertes Ansprechen zuckerspeichernder Zellen wie Fett- und Muskelzellen auf Insulin (Insulinresistenz) durch \u00dcberkonsum von Kohlenhydraten und Zucker oder eine verminderte Insulinaussch\u00fcttung der Bauchspeicheldr\u00fcse. In ersterem Fall kann die Insulinaussch\u00fcttung sogar erh\u00f6ht sein. Deshalb r\u00e4t die Weltgesundheitsorganisation zur Zuckersteuer um einen sp\u00fcrbaren R\u00fcckgang des Zuckerkonsums zu erreichen, damit weniger Menschen an \u00dcbergewicht, Fettleibigkeit und Zuckerkrankheit leiden. Der Spiegel des Wachstumshormons (Somatropin) ist beim gesunden Menschen nur dann erh\u00f6ht, wenn der Insulinspiegel zu niedrig ist. Es steigert den Blutzuckerspiegel, indem es sowohl die Aufnahme von Zucker in Fett- und Muskelzellen hemmt, als auch den Zuckerverbrauch durch eine vermehrte Bereitstellung von Fetten (Fetts\u00e4ureoxidation) insbesondere im Muskel reduziert. Sind beide Hormone erh\u00f6ht, kann es zu einer Hyperglyk\u00e4mie kommen, weil die blutzuckersenkende Wirkung des Insulins an den zuckerspeichernden Zellen dann eingeschr\u00e4nkt ist. Bei einer Schilddr\u00fcsen\u00fcberfunktion werden Glykogenolyse und Glukoneogenese angeregt, bei der H\u00e4mochromatose f\u00fchrt der erh\u00f6hte Eisenspiegel in der Bauchspeicheldr\u00fcse zu Siderose und Fibrose, wobei dann auch die Funktion der insulinbildenden Beta-Zellen beeintr\u00e4chtigt wird. Beim Glukagonom bewirkt ein erh\u00f6hter Glukagonspiegel eine Zunahme der Glukoneogenese bei gleichzeitiger Abnahme von Glykogenolyse und Glukoseverbrauch. Schwere Erkrankungen wie Herzinfarkt, schwere Infekte oder Traumata k\u00f6nnen ebenso wie Narkosen eine Hyperglyk\u00e4mie bewirken. Ursache ist der davon ausgel\u00f6ste Postaggressionsstoffwechsel, bei dem es zu einer peripheren Insulinresistenz kommt, wobei dann auch die Gabe von Insulin nicht zu einer ausreichenden Senkung des Blutzuckerspiegels f\u00fchrt."}

Dieses Verteilungsmuster deute auf genetische Einfl\u00fcsse und ist konsistent mit der Hypothese einer oder mehrerer Gr\u00fcnder-Mutationen in Nordwesteuropa. Erstbeschreiber und Namensgeber der Krankheit war 1877 der Pathologe und Chirurg James Paget aus England, wo die Krankheit am h\u00e4ufigsten ist.

Lebensjahr tritt die Erkrankung selten auf, die Pr\u00e4valenz steigt danach jedoch stetig. Allerdings ist nur ein Bruchteil dieser Patienten klinisch auff\u00e4llig und behandlungsbed\u00fcrftig. Zuletzt wurde ein R\u00fcckgang der Inzidenz und der Schwere der Auspr\u00e4gung des M. Paget beobachtet. Der Entstehungsmechanismus der Osteodystrophia deformans ist unbekannt. Da man paramyxovirale RNA, Antigene und Nukleokapside (z. B. Masernviren und Hundestaupeviren) in Osteoklasten, Osteoblasten und Osteozyten findet, geht man von einem viralen Einfluss aus. Die Identit\u00e4t der Einschlussk\u00f6rperchen im Zellkern, die Paramyxovirus-Nukleokapsiden \u00e4hneln, konnte jedoch noch nicht zweifelsfrei gekl\u00e4rt werden. Bei etwa 15 % aller Patienten liegt eine positive Familienanamnese vor, und hierbei zeigt sich ein autosomal-dominanter Erbgang mit unvollst\u00e4ndiger Penetranz. Von den Patienten mit positiver Familienanamnese weisen 40 bis 50 % eine Mutation des Gens SQSTM1 (Sequestosome 1, Lokalisation 5q35) auf, das das Protein p62 codiert, welches f\u00fcr die Regulierung der Funktion von Osteoklasten wichtig ist. Auch 5 bis 10 % der Patienten mit einem sporadischen, nicht-famili\u00e4ren M. Paget weisen eine SQSTM1-Mutation auf. Dar\u00fcber hinaus gibt es Genmutationen in drei verschiedenen Genen, die f\u00fcnf seltene klinische Syndrome mit Osteoklasten-St\u00f6rungen verursachen, die dem Morbus Paget \u00e4hnlich sind: - Insertionsmutationen in Exon 1 des Gens TNFRSF11A (tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 11a, NFKB activator, Lokalisation 18q22."}

Das DSPP-Gen ist f\u00fcr die Produktion von drei Proteinen ma\u00dfgeblich verantwortlich und bei der Zahnentwicklung essentiell. Die Mutation ver\u00e4ndert diese Proteine so, dass die Anordnung des Dentins, welches f\u00fcr die mittlere sch\u00fctzende Zahnschicht verantwortlich ist, gest\u00f6rt ist. Das Dentin wird atypisch, da die Odontoblasten (Dentin bildende Zellen) durch andere Zellen ersetzt werden. Dies f\u00fchrt zu einem \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfig hohem Wasseranteil im Zahn (60 %), bei einem gleichzeitigen \u00e4u\u00dferst niedrigen Mineralanteil im Zahnschmelz und im Dentin. Bei einer ausbleibenden Behandlung kann es zum kompletten Abrieb des Zahnes bis hin zum Zahnfleisch kommen. Die Behandlung zielt darauf, die Abrasion m\u00f6glichst zu minimieren, die Z\u00e4hne zu rehabilitieren, die extreme Verschlei\u00dferscheinungen aufweisen, die \u00c4sthetik zu optimieren, und auf die Pr\u00e4vention von Folgesch\u00e4den. Normalerweise werden die Backenz\u00e4hne mit Zahnkronen versehen, dies hilft die Zahnabnutzung zu vermindern und den Ober- und Unterkiefer zu stabilisieren. Auf den prim\u00e4ren hinteren Zahnpartien werden rostfreie Stahlkronen platziert, und die Frontz\u00e4hne werden mit zahnfarbenem F\u00fcllmaterial behandelt. Dies ist f\u00fcr alle permanenten Z\u00e4hne erforderlich. Bei einzelnen Syndromen kann diese Erkrankung ein Merkmal sein, s."}

Auf diese erworbenen Formen, die je nach Ursache in Lokalisation und Symptomatik sehr unterschiedlich sein k\u00f6nnen, wird im Folgenden nicht mehr eingegangen. In der \u00fcberwiegenden Zahl handelt es sich um angeborene Fisteln bei einer Fehlbildung von Speise- und Luftr\u00f6hre.

Liegt eine \u00d6sophagusatresie vor, so bestimmt diese die klinische Symptomatik. Handelt es sich dagegen um eine isolierte Fistel, gilt die Kombination von Hustenattacken, chronisch rezidivierende Aspirationspneumonie und Meteorismus als wegweisend. Weitere klinische Hinweise auf eine Fistel sind: - Trinkverweigerung - Blau-werden beim Trinkversuch - Rezidivierende Aspirationen - Oberlappenatelektase H-Fisteln verlaufen von der Trachea vorwiegend in H\u00f6he von HWK 6 bis BWK 2 und liegen deutlich h\u00f6her als die Fisteln bei einer \u00d6sophagusatresie und verl\u00e4uft von der Vorderwand des \u00d6sophagus jeweils schr\u00e4g nach kranial zur Luftr\u00f6hre.

Schlie\u00dflich werden in der Niere einige hormonaktive Stoffe wie Renin, Erythropoetin und Calcitriol (aktive Form des Vitamin D) hergestellt. Dadurch hat das Organ eine wesentliche Bedeutung f\u00fcr die Regulation des Blutdrucks, der Blutneubildung beziehungsweise des Calcium- und Phosphorhaushalts und damit des Knochenstoffwechsels. Katzen sind als Fleischfresser in besonderem Ma\u00dfe auf die Zufuhr tierischer Proteine angewiesen, weil bei ihnen die Traubenzuckerbildung aus Aminos\u00e4uren die wichtigste Energiequelle ist. Die Enzyme des Aminos\u00e4ureabbaus sind an die hohe Proteinzufuhr angepasst und ihre Aktivit\u00e4t ist weitgehend unabh\u00e4ngig vom Proteinangebot in der Nahrung, so dass Katzen bei mangelnder Proteinzufuhr k\u00f6rpereigene Proteine (vor allem aus der Muskulatur) abbauen (katabole Stoffwechsellage). Fleisch und Innereien enthalten dar\u00fcber hinaus f\u00fcr die Katze lebensnotwendige N\u00e4hrstoffe wie beispielsweise Vitamin A, Taurin oder Arachidons\u00e4ure. Verglichen mit der normalen Kost eines Menschen nehmen Katzen mit dem handels\u00fcblichen Katzenfutter im Verh\u00e4ltnis rund sechsmal mehr Nahrungsphosphat zu sich. Dadurch ist es schwierig, eine \u00e4hnliche Phosphorreduktion in der Katzennahrung zu erreichen, wie sie in der Humanmedizin f\u00fcr menschliche Nierendi\u00e4ten angestrebt wird. Krankheitserscheinungen treten erst in einem fortgeschrittenen Stadium auf, wenn bereits mehr als zwei Drittel der urspr\u00fcnglichen Nierenfunktion verloren sind. Dies ist den k\u00f6rpereigenen Kompensationsmechanismen und der Reservekapazit\u00e4t der Niere geschuldet, die die reduzierte Nierenfunktion lange ausgleichen und die Ausscheidung harnpflichtiger Substanzen dabei aufrechterhalten k\u00f6nnen. Mit dem Verlust funktionierender Nephrone \u2013 der funktionellen Baueinheit der Niere \u2013 nimmt die Filterleistung der Nierenk\u00f6rperchen (glomerul\u00e4re Filtrationsrate) ab und damit die Ausscheidungskapazit\u00e4t f\u00fcr harnpflichtige Stoffe. Die erh\u00f6hten Harnstoffwerte im Blut (Ur\u00e4mie) f\u00fchren aus verschiedenen Ursachen zu \u00dcbelkeit und Erbrechen. Zum einen reizen sie direkt Chemorezeptoren der Chemorezeptoren-Triggerzone im Gehirn. Zweitens erh\u00f6hen sie die Gastrinsekretion und f\u00fchren so zu einer Steigerung der Magens\u00e4urebildung und damit zu einer \u00dcbers\u00e4uerung des Magens. Schlie\u00dflich rufen sie eine Gef\u00e4\u00dfentz\u00fcndung (ur\u00e4mische Vaskulitis) hervor, die zu weiteren Sch\u00e4den am Verdauungstrakt f\u00fchrt. Infolge der Phosphatanreicherung im Blut (Hyperphosphat\u00e4mie) und der verminderten Bildung von Calcitriol in den verbliebenen Hauptst\u00fccken kommt es zu einem Abfall des Calciumblutspiegels (Hypokalz\u00e4mie), und es wird vermehrt Parathormon aus der Nebenschilddr\u00fcse freigesetzt.

Sie sind obligat anaerobe gram-positive Sporenbildner, die auch im menschlichen Darm zu finden sind, wo sie aber unter normalen Bedingungen nicht pathogen (krankheitserregend) sind. Die Pathogenit\u00e4t ergibt sich erst mit dem Wechsel der Umweltbedingungen auf ein anaerobes Milieu (Sauerstoffmangel), wie es in zerst\u00f6rtem Weichteilgewebe mit erniedrigtem Sauerstoffpartialdruck existiert. Meistens sind verletzungsbedingt stark verschmutzte, zerst\u00f6rte und zerkl\u00fcftete Gewebebereiche der Ort, an dem die Clostridien ihre Pathogenit\u00e4t erlangen, wo sich also aus Sporen Bakterien entwickeln, die sich dann vermehren. Grundlegend ist der Sauerstoffmangel (Clostridien sind anaerobe Erreger). Beg\u00fcnstigend sind die Minderdurchblutung durch Weichteilquetschung, Gewebeuntergang (Nekrosen), Schock, Begleiterkrankungen wie Diabetes mellitus und b\u00f6sartige Tumoren. Zus\u00e4tzlich bringt die Verschmutzung der Wunde eine Infektion mit aeroben (sauerstoffverbrauchenden) Erregern mit sich, was den Sauerstoffmangel im infizierten Gewebe f\u00f6rdert und die Lebensbedingungen f\u00fcr die Clostridien verbessert. Clostridien bilden au\u00dfer CO verschiedene Exotoxine, die im umgebenden Gewebe eine Zellmembranzerst\u00f6rung und \u00d6dembildung bewirken und somit im Sinne eines Teufelskreises (Circulus vitiosus) weiteren N\u00e4hrboden f\u00fcr den Erreger zur Verf\u00fcgung stellen. Zus\u00e4tzlich wirken Exotoxine von Clostridien auf wei\u00dfe Blutk\u00f6rperchen (Leukozyten) funktionshemmend bis abt\u00f6tend. Sie f\u00f6rdern zudem den Verschluss kleiner Blutgef\u00e4\u00dfe durch Thrombosen, was den Sauerstoffmangel im betroffenen Gewebe durch eine Durchblutungsst\u00f6rung weiter verst\u00e4rkt und das f\u00fcr die Clostridien optimale Wachstumsmilieu f\u00f6rdert. Nach einer Inkubationszeit von 5 bis 48 Stunden f\u00e4llt nach Operationen oder Weichteilverletzungen eine sich rasch ausbreitende Wundinfektion auf (R\u00f6tung, Hitze im Wundbereich), die extrem schmerzhaft ist. In den meisten F\u00e4llen ist beim Betasten (Palpieren) der Wundumgebung ein auff\u00e4lliges Knistern zu h\u00f6ren und zu f\u00fchlen: ein Hautemphysem durch CO-Bildung (Hautkrepitation).

Diese bis heute nur sehr unvollst\u00e4ndig klassifizierten Mediatoren scheinen im Zuge der CIP eine toxische Wirkung auf die Axone speziell der motorischen Neurone des peripheren Nervensystems auszu\u00fcben. Es handelt sich somit um eine endogen-toxische Polyneuropathie. Die Sch\u00e4digung der motorischen Neurone f\u00fchrt zu einer Parese (L\u00e4hmung) der dazugeh\u00f6rigen Muskeln. Die Konsequenz daraus ist deren Verk\u00fcmmerung. Sensorische Neurone scheinen bei diesem Krankheitsprozess weitgehend, jedoch nicht vollst\u00e4ndig, ausgespart zu bleiben. Die Verlaufsform der CIP ist monophasisch und selbstlimitierend. Die Patienten entwickeln schwere, schlaffe, atrophische L\u00e4hmungen. S\u00e4mtliche Extremit\u00e4ten sind davon betroffen.

Beim Versuch, die Patienten von der maschinellen Beatmung zu entw\u00f6hnen, ergeben sich manchmal jedoch erhebliche Schwierigkeiten. Anzumerken ist, dass die CIP in den meisten F\u00e4llen nicht den Schweregrad erreicht, um besagte Entw\u00f6hnungsst\u00f6rungen zu verursachen. Klinisch nachweisbar ist diese Art der Erkrankung ansonsten nur schwer. Bei der neurologischen Statuierung finden sich die erw\u00e4hnten Muskelatrophien mit eigenartig teigiger Gewebskonsistenz.

Das Reservoir, aus dem das Virus stammt, ist bis heute nicht zweifelsfrei bestimmt. Vermutlich ist der \u00dcbertr\u00e4ger der Nilflughund, eine Fledermausart, die in Europa und Afrika vorkommt. Die Theorie, dass Fledertiere das nat\u00fcrliche Reservoir von Filoviren darstellen, wird unter anderem durch das geh\u00e4ufte Auftreten von Marburgfieber in Folge eines H\u00f6hlenbesuches gest\u00fctzt. So waren in Durba (Kongo, 1998\u20132000) 53 % (75/142) aller Infizierten Minenarbeiter in h\u00e4ufigem Kontakt zu Fledertieren. Das Virus stammt vermutlich aus Zentralafrika. Sehr wahrscheinlich wurde es 1967 mit Versuchsaffen (Meerkatzen) aus Uganda in die Laboratorien des Pharmakonzerns Behringwerke im hessischen Marburg eingeschleppt. Die Folgeerkrankung, das Marburgfieber, trat zuerst bei den dort besch\u00e4ftigten Laboranten auf, und das Virus wurde anschlie\u00dfend in der Tropenklinik von Marburg zum ersten Mal identifiziert. Daher hat es den Namen Marburgvirus erhalten. Das Fieber trat sp\u00e4ter auch in Frankfurt am Main und in Belgrad auf. Von den damals 31 Erkrankten starben sieben. Das Marburgvirus wird haupts\u00e4chlich durch den Kontakt mit K\u00f6rperfl\u00fcssigkeiten (Blut, Stuhl, Urin, Speichel, Muttermilch usw. ) \u00fcbertragen. Eine Mensch-zu-Mensch-\u00dcbertragung \u00fcber Aerosole scheint eine geringe Rolle bei der Verbreitung in nat\u00fcrlichen Ausbr\u00fcchen zu spielen. In Laborversuchen konnte hingegen gezeigt werden, dass Marburgviren in Aerosolen stabil und f\u00fcr Primaten hoch infekti\u00f6s sind. Zudem werden die Inhalation von Fledermaus-Exkreten sowie der Konsum von rohem Fledermausfleisch als prim\u00e4rer Weg der \u00dcbertragung von Tier zu Mensch angesehen. Dar\u00fcber hinaus bestehen Unterschiede zwischen der Mortalit\u00e4t in Abh\u00e4ngigkeit vom Infektionsweg.

Grunds\u00e4tzlich unterscheidet man das endogene und das exogene Cushing-Syndrom. Letzteres ist wesentlich h\u00e4ufiger und wird von \u00e4u\u00dferen Einfl\u00fcssen verursacht, insbesondere durch die l\u00e4ngerfristige Einnahme von Glucocorticoiden (haupts\u00e4chlich Cortison). Das viel seltenere endogene Cushing-Syndrom betrifft Frauen bis zu viermal h\u00e4ufiger als M\u00e4nner und kann in allen Altersstufen auftreten. Dabei produziert die Nebennierenrinde, ohne dazu angeregt zu werden, zu viel Cortisol (Nebennierenrindenautonomie). Wird die Nebennierenrinde jedoch durch das Stimulationshormon ACTH angeregt, weil ein Tumor der Hypophyse vorliegt, wird die Erkrankung Morbus Cushing benannt. Die Ursachen eines Cushing-Syndroms k\u00f6nnen sein: - Zentrales Cushing-Syndrom (hypothalamisch-hypophys\u00e4r): Erh\u00f6hte Produktion von ACTH (Adrenocorticotropes Hormon) im Hypophysenvorderlappen (Morbus Cushing, Cushingsche Erkrankung), seltener erh\u00f6hte Produktion von CRH im Hypothalamus mit anschlie\u00dfend vermehrter Kortikoidfreisetzung aus der Nebennierenrinde. - Adrenales Cushing-Syndrom: Gesteigerte Sekretion von Glukokortikoiden aus der Nebennierenrinde im Zuge von Neoplasien (Adenome oder Karzinome der Nebennierenrinde) mit nachfolgend unterdr\u00fcckter ACTH-Aussch\u00fcttung aus dem Hypophysenvorderlappen. - Ektopisches (paraneoplastisches) Cushing-Syndrom: Bildung von ACTH (oder sehr selten CRH) in ektopem Gewebe, meist im Rahmen eines kleinzelligen Bronchialkarzinoms. - Iatrogenes (durch \u00e4rztliche Therapie verursachtes) Cushing-Syndrom: Ausbruch der Symptomatik nach regelm\u00e4\u00dfiger, systemischer Gabe von ACTH oder Kortikoiden im Rahmen der Behandlung von Erkrankungen, etwa Autoimmunerkrankungen oder Allergien. - Pseudo-Cushing-Syndrom (Cushingoid): Vor\u00fcbergehende Cushing-Symptomatik, beispielsweise im Zuge von schweren Sch\u00e4delverletzungen. Die Symptome des Cushing-Syndroms sind durch die verst\u00e4rkte hormonelle Wirkung der Kortikoide auf die Zielgewebe bedingt.

Bald trat in Gegenden mit hohem Maiskonsum eine seltsame Erkrankung auf, die nach dem Leitsymptom Pellagra \u201araue Haut\u2018 genannt wurde. Der Zusammenhang von Pellagra und hohem Maiskonsum wurde schon im 18. Jahrhundert vermutet. Erkl\u00e4rungen der damaligen Zeit waren verschimmelter oder vergifteter Mais, Ansteckung oder Vererbung. Erst Joseph Goldberger und Kollegen bewiesen Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts, dass sowohl die sogenannte Pellagra des Menschen als auch die Schwarze-Zunge-Krankheit des Hundes durch Fehlern\u00e4hrung entsteht, genauer (Conrad Elvehjem 1937) durch einen Nicotins\u00e4uremangel. Heutzutage tritt Pellagra in der Regel nur noch in armen Gegenden Afrikas oder bei extremer Fehl- oder Mangelern\u00e4hrung, zum Beispiel bei Magersucht, auf. Die Entdeckung, dass Pellagra mit Bierhefe behandelbar ist, f\u00fchrte in den betroffenen Gebieten zu einer schlagartigen Verringerung der Anzahl der Insassen von Nervenheilanstalten. In Analogie dazu setzten die \u00c4rzte Abram Hoffer und Humphry Osmond in der sogenannten Mega-Vitamintherapie hohe Dosen Nicotins\u00e4ure zur Behandlung von Schizophrenien ein. Sie gingen davon aus, dass wenn die im Rahmen einer Pellagra aufgetretenen Symptome der Schizophrenie durch die Behandlung mit Nicotins\u00e4ure verschwinden, k\u00f6nnte diese vielleicht auch Schizophrenien anderer Ursache beeinflussen.

Aufgrund der von ihm durchgef\u00fchrten Experimente kam er zu dem Schluss, sie am ehesten mit Kolloidgewebe vergleichen zu k\u00f6nnen: Aber wie ist sie zu nennen? F\u00fcr den Augenblick weiss ich es in der That nicht, aber der Begriff von dem hybriden Wort Colloid ist so dehnbar, dass ich glaube nicht indiscret zu sein, wenn ich mir darin vorl\u00e4ufig ein Pl\u00e4tzchen f\u00fcr diese Kugeln erbitte. Ich will sie daher einfach Colloidkugeln nennen. Und weiter: Wie und woraus entwickeln sich diese Kugeln? Beim ersten Anblick kam es mir bereits wahrscheinlich vor, dass sie aus den Kernen der Pigmentzellen entstehen. Weitere Untersuchungen haben mich von der Richtigkeit dieser Vermuthung vollst\u00e4ndig \u00fcberzeugt. Diese Feststellung legte den Grundstein f\u00fcr die Transformationstheorie \u00fcber die Entstehung von Drusen. Bereits ein Jahr sp\u00e4ter, 1856, entwickelte H. M\u00fcller die sog. Depositionstheorie, wonach Drusen aus Ablagerungen von Abbauprodukten der Netzhaut entstehen. Er f\u00fchrte auch den Begriff \"Druse\" ein, in Anlehnung an deren Aussehen, das ihn an die mineralischen Steinformationen erinnerte. Der Begriff Druse setzte sich schlussendlich in der internationalen Fachliteratur durch. Als Druse wird definitionsgem\u00e4\u00df eine fokale Ablagerung von extrazellul\u00e4rem Material zwischen der basalen Lamina des retinalen Pigmentepithels und der inneren kollagenen Schicht der Bruch\u00b4schen Membran bezeichnet.

Histologisch wurde jedoch eine wesentlich gr\u00f6\u00dfere Vielfalt an unterschiedlichen Drusenformen beobachtet.

Nottingham berichtete von F\u00e4llen mit \"konischer Hornhaut\" und beschrieb mehrere Merkmale der Krankheit wie Diplopie, Schw\u00e4chung der Hornhaut, und Schwierigkeiten beim Sehen mit Korrekturlinsen. Im Jahr 1859 benutzte der Chirurg William Bowman ein Ophthalmoskop (kurz zuvor von Hermann von Helmholtz erfunden), um den Keratokonus genauer zu diagnostizieren. Bowman f\u00fchrte einen feinen Haken durch die Hornhaut ein, mit dem er an der Iris zog und die Pupille zu einem senkrechten Schlitz - wie bei einer Katze - ausdehnte. Diese Methode konnte er er erfolgreich bei einer 18-j\u00e4hrigen Frau anwenden. 1869 bekam die St\u00f6rung von dem Schweizer Augenarzt Johann Friedrich Horner ihren heute g\u00fcltigen Namen. Der Keratokonus tritt in den L\u00e4ndern der westlichen Welt bei ca. 1 Person pro ca. 1000\u20132000 Einwohnern auf.

In der Fachzeitschrift Cell stand Anfang 2015 ein Bericht des Clinical Center der National Institutes of Health in Bethesda/Maryland \u00fcber einen Fall von Spontanheilung durch Chromothripsis. Charakteristisch f\u00fcr das WHIM-Syndrom ist eine Immunschw\u00e4che, die sich in wiederkehrenden bakteriellen und viralen Infektionen \u00e4u\u00dfert. Davon sind insbesondere die Atemwege mit Nasennebenh\u00f6hlenentz\u00fcndungen, Mandelentz\u00fcndungen und Lungenentz\u00fcndungen betroffen. Die Patienten sind anf\u00e4llig f\u00fcr Infektionen mit humanen Papillomaviren, die sich in zahlreichen Warzen, insbesondere im Hand- und Fu\u00dfbereich, \u00e4u\u00dfern.

Als h\u00e4ufigste Ursache, die bei 92 % der betroffenen Patienten gefunden wurde, werden Mutationen eines Gens auf dem Genlocus 2q21, das den Chemokinrezeptor CXCR4 codiert, angesehen. Diese Mutationen im intrazellul\u00e4ren Teil des membranst\u00e4ndigen Rezeptors f\u00fcr das Zytokin CXCL12 (SDF-1) f\u00fchren zu einem verk\u00fcrzten Rezeptorprotein, dem die F\u00e4higkeit der Internalisierung nach Aktivierung fehlt. Somit sind Mechanismen der negativen Selbstregulation unterbrochen und der Rezeptor kann dauerstimuliert werden. Eine Verminderung der Expression von CXCR4 ist zudem Voraussetzung f\u00fcr das Verlassen von T-Vorl\u00e4uferzellen aus dem Knochenmark. Aufgrund der Mutation und der fehlenden Internalisierung von CXCR4 bleibt auf der Oberfl\u00e4che der TZ-Vorl\u00e4uferzellen. Diese Vorl\u00e4uferzellen k\u00f6nnen daher das Knochenmark nicht verlassen und sind die Ursache f\u00fcr die histologischen Befunde im Knochenmark und Blut. Das WHIM-Syndrom kann jedoch vereinzelt auch bei Patienten (bei 8 % der Patienten) mit einem nicht-mutierten (Wildtyp) CXCR4 beobachtet werden. Eine m\u00f6gliche Ursache bei diesen Patienten ist eine Fehlfunktion von Proteinen, die an der Internalisierung von CXCR4 beteiligt sind, wie beispielsweise G-Protein-gekoppelte Rezeptorkinasen (GRKs). Da der CXCR4-Rezeptor auch bei anderen Migrations- und Homingprozessen eine Rolle spielt, ist auch die Immunabwehr in der Peripherie gest\u00f6rt. In der Behandlung von Patienten mit einem WHIM-Syndrom steht die Reduktion der Infektanf\u00e4lligkeit im Vordergrund. Eine Substitution mit Immunglobulinen soll die Infekth\u00e4ufigkeit senken. Zur Normalisierung der Freisetzung Neutrophiler Granulozyten aus dem Knochenmark kann GM-CSF oder besser G-CSF eingesetzt werden."}

Paul Meehl baute diese Idee dann in seinen Arbeiten zur Schizotaxie weiter aus. Die schizotypische Pers\u00f6nlichkeitsst\u00f6rung ist durch einen oftmals unfreiwilligen sozialen R\u00fcckzug gekennzeichnet. Nur selten kn\u00fcpfen Schizotypische soziale Kontakte und es f\u00e4llt ihnen schwer, diese aufrechtzuerhalten, da ihr Misstrauen gegen Menschen gro\u00df ist. Auch durch l\u00e4ngeres Zusammensein wird dieses nicht abgebaut, sondern eher st\u00e4rker. Nicht selten steigert sich dies zu einem reizbaren und aggressiven Verhalten. Mitmenschen f\u00e4llt ihr unzug\u00e4ngliches, gem\u00fctsarm und gleichg\u00fcltig wirkendes Verhalten auf. Als typisch wird ein unkonventionelles Verhalten beschrieben, welches sich in einem skurrilen und grotesken bis ungepflegten \u00e4u\u00dferen Erscheinungsbild oder einer idiosynkratischen Sprache \u00e4u\u00dfert.

Hochgradig Schizotypische sind jedoch selten k\u00fcnstlerisch begabt, sondern denken und handeln eher technisch-funktionell und abstrakt.

In der besonders gef\u00e4hrdeten Gruppe der persistent infizierten (oder PI-) Tiere betragen beide 100 Prozent. Die Bovine Virusdiarrhoe, kurz BVD, ist eine Virusinfektion der Rinder, die durch ein Pestivirus aus der Familie der Flaviviridae verursacht wird. Die BVD kommt weltweit vor und z\u00e4hlt zu den wirtschaftlich bedeutendsten Erkrankungen des Rindes. Das Krankheitsbild ist \u00e4u\u00dferst vielf\u00e4ltig. Die Mucosal Disease, kurz MD, ist eine immer t\u00f6dliche Erkrankung meist junger Rinder (3 bis 24 Monate), die durch Erosionen an allen Schleimh\u00e4uten charakterisiert ist (siehe Bild). Bemerkenswert ist dabei das Ausbleiben einer Immunreaktion trotz vorhandenem Virus der zytopathischen Form. Erfolgt die Infektion bei einem Tier im ersten oder letzten Drittel der Tr\u00e4chtigkeit, kann es zu schweren Fehlbildungen bzw. zum Abort der Frucht kommen. Infektionen mit der zytopathischen Form im zweiten Drittel der Tr\u00e4chtigkeit f\u00fchrt meist zu Abort oder Mumifikation. Die Infektion erfolgt entweder horizontal (d. h. von einem anderen Tier) oder vertikal (d. h. schon w\u00e4hrend der Tr\u00e4chtigkeit vom Muttertier auf das ungeborene Kalb). Bei einer horizontalen Infektion entwickelt das Tier nach der Ansteckung mit zytopathischem oder nicht-zytopathischem BVDV Symptome der BVD, eliminiert das Virus in einer normalen Immunreaktion unter Bildung von Antik\u00f6rpern und beh\u00e4lt eine dauerhafte Immunit\u00e4t (hit-and-run-Strategie). Die vertikale Infektion kann erfolgen, wenn sich das Muttertier im zweiten Drittel der Tr\u00e4chtigkeit mit dem nicht-zytopathischen BVDV infiziert. Das Virus geht in diesem Fall auf den Fetus \u00fcber. Da dieser sich in der Phase der Immuntoleranz befindet, erkennt sein Immunsystem das Virus nicht als fremdes Antigen. Es bildet daher keine Antik\u00f6rper und das Jungtier bleibt lebenslang mit dem Virus infiziert und scheidet dieses permanent aus, ohne aber selbst Symptome zu zeigen."}

Als pathogenetische Ursache der Non-Compaction-Kardiomyopathie wird eine St\u00f6rung in diesem komplexen Prozess postuliert. Auch eine Trennung (Dissektion) des Myokards, Einrisse oder Stoffwechselst\u00f6rungen des Gewebes werden diskutiert. Der Herzmuskel ist schwammartig aufgetrieben.

Neben diesen x-chromosomal gebundenen Mutationen (siehe auch Barth-Syndrom) sind auch autosomal-dominante Vererbungen anderer Proteine (Dystrobrevin (DTAN), LIM-Domain-binding-Proteine und Sarkomer-Proteine) beschrieben.

Mouches volantes lassen sich durch Schatten- und Beugungseffekte an diesen Kondensaten erkl\u00e4ren, die umso st\u00e4rker sind, je mehr Licht ins Auge f\u00e4llt, und umso deutlicher gesehen werden, je n\u00e4her die Ungleichm\u00e4\u00dfigkeiten vor der Netzhaut liegen. H\u00e4ufig treten sie in Verbindung mit h\u00f6hergradiger Kurzsichtigkeit auf. Mouches volantes nimmt fast jeder Mensch im Laufe seines Lebens bei bestimmten Lichtverh\u00e4ltnissen wahr. Die Diagnose bezeichnet eine harmlose, allerdings manchmal st\u00f6rende Ver\u00e4nderung. Der Visus, der zur Bewertung der Beeintr\u00e4chtigung herangezogen wird, ist kein verl\u00e4sslicher Parameter, um den Grad der Beeintr\u00e4chtigungen zu messen, weil er im Sitzen, ohne Augen- und Kopfbewegungen, durchgef\u00fchrt wird. Dadurch kommen die Glask\u00f6rpertr\u00fcbungen, die sonst st\u00e4ndig im Auge hin- und herschwimmen, zum Stillstand. Der Krankheitswert wird in hohem Ma\u00dfe durch den Schweregrad, die Typisierung, die Lokalisation im zentralen Blickfeld, die N\u00e4he zur Netzhaut, die Mobilit\u00e4t der Tr\u00fcbungen und vor allem die subjektive Beeintr\u00e4chtigung bestimmt.

In einer retrospektiven Studie mit 116 Patienten trat in 2,5 % der F\u00e4lle eine Netzhautabl\u00f6sung auf. Alternativ werden minimalinvasive Techniken erforscht, die nur einen sehr begrenzten Teil des Glask\u00f6rpers, entweder alle betroffenen Stellen oder die in der Sichtachse befindlichen Teile, entfernen (sog. Core-Vitrectomy oder Floaterectomy). In begrenztem Umfang werden auch Laserbehandlungen durchgef\u00fchrt, deren Nutzen und Erfolg jedoch kontrovers diskutiert werden.

Der Altersgipfel des Warthin-Tumors liegt in der 6. -7. Lebensdekade, wobei das mittlere Erkrankungsalter mit 62 Jahren angegeben wird. Eine Manifestation bereits im Kindesalter ist zwar m\u00f6glich, jedoch tritt der Tumor nur selten vor dem 40. Lebensjahr auf. Die historische deutliche Pr\u00e4ferenz des Tumors f\u00fcr das m\u00e4nnliche Geschlecht, die noch 1953 mit 10 : 1 angegeben wurde, hat sich mutma\u00dflich aufgrund ge\u00e4nderter Lebensgewohnheiten (Tabakabusus) deutlich zuungunsten des weiblichen Geschlechts verschoben. Neuere Zahlen zeigen nur noch eine gering erh\u00f6hte Krankheitsh\u00e4ufigkeit bei M\u00e4nnern oder gar ein ausgeglichenes Geschlechtsverh\u00e4ltnis. Die Inzidenz der Erkrankung bei Afroamerikanern und Schwarzafrikanern ist niedriger als bei Wei\u00dfen, wobei jedoch bei Afroamerikanern in den vergangenen Dekaden eine H\u00e4ufigkeitszunahme beobachtet werden konnte. Die eigentlichen, der Tumorentstehung zugrundeliegenden Ursachen sind weitgehend unbekannt.

Auch das lymphoide Stroma des Warthin-Tumors ist neueren Erkenntnissen zufolge polyklonalen Ursprungs und damit vermutlich lediglich reaktiv und nicht neoplastisch. Andere Arbeiten wiederum konnten zumindest bei einem Teil der Warthin-Tumoren eine Translokation zwischen Chromosom 11 und 19 mit Ausbildung eines Fusionsgens (CRTC1-MAML2) demonstrieren. Diese Ver\u00e4nderung wird interessanterweise auch beim mukoepidermoiden Karzinom gefunden.

Typisch sind hierbei Schmerzen in H\u00f6he der krankhaft ver\u00e4nderten Gelenke bzw. knapp darunter, h\u00e4ufig mit Ausstrahlung in Richtung der Beine. Da die Facettengelenksnerven Seiten\u00e4ste der unmittelbar benachbarten Nervenwurzel sind, ist die Schmerzausstrahlung eines Facettensyndroms \u00e4hnlich der Reizung einer Nervenwurzel (Wurzelreizsyndrom, Radikulopathie), jedoch ohne die f\u00fcr das Wurzelreizsyndrom charakteristischen Empfindungsst\u00f6rungen wie Taubheit, Kribbeln oder pelziges Gef\u00fchl. In der Regel strahlen die Schmerzen auch nicht so weit nach unten aus und folgen nicht dem typischen, von einer Nervenwurzel versorgten, Hautareal (Dermatom). Typischerweise verschlimmern sich die Schmerzen durch Belastung der Facettengelenke, z. B. durch Beugung ins Hohlkreuz (Retroflexion) oder Seitneigung aber auch durch l\u00e4ngeres Stehen oder Gehen. Ein Facettensyndrom kann sich auch im Bereich der Halswirbels\u00e4ule einstellen insbesondere nach einem Schleudertrauma. Die Diagnose ergibt sich haupts\u00e4chlich durch die Krankheitsgeschichte (Anamnese) und die k\u00f6rperliche Untersuchung. Da das Facettensyndrom im Anfangsstadium schwer von unspezifischen R\u00fcckenschmerzen unterscheidbar ist und sich unspezifische R\u00fcckenschmerzen oft ohne weitere Ma\u00dfnahmen (spontan) bessern, wird eine bildgebende Diagnostik wie R\u00f6ntgen, Computertomographie (CT) oder Kernspintomographie (Magnetresonanztomographie, MRT) bei fehlenden Hinweisen auf einen gef\u00e4hrlichen Verlauf nur im Falle l\u00e4nger dauernder Beschwerden (> 6\u201312 Wochen) ohne Besserungstendenz unter konservativer Therapie empfohlen.

Laut Definition der Konferenz der \u201eEuropean Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology\u201c (ESHRE) und der \u201eAmerican Society for Reproductive Medicine\u201c (ASRM), die 2003 in Rotterdam vorgestellt wurde, liegt ein PCO-Syndrom vor, wenn zwei der drei folgenden Kriterien erf\u00fcllt sind: - Polyzystische Ovarien \u2013 Zysten in den Eierst\u00f6cken. Das polyzystische Ovar (PCO) ist durch acht und mehr subkapsul\u00e4re Zysten mit einem maximalen Querschnitt von zehn Millimetern und durch eine relative Vermehrung des Stromagewebes definiert. Ein zus\u00e4tzliches Kriterium ist die Ovarvergr\u00f6\u00dferung. Je nach Definition haben 80 bis 100 Prozent der PCOS-Patientinnen polyzystische Ovarien. Ob polyzystische Ovarien vorliegen, kann mittels Ultraschalldiagnostik festgestellt werden.

Zyklusst\u00f6rungen sind ein fr\u00fch auftretendes klinisches Symptom und bestehen h\u00e4ufig bereits direkt nach der zum normalen Zeitpunkt auftretenden Menarche. Bei unregelm\u00e4\u00dfigen Zyklen gilt es zwischen der sogenannten Oligomenorrhoe und der Amenorrhoe zu unterscheiden. Oligomenorrhoe liegt vor, wenn die Abst\u00e4nde der Blutungen l\u00e4nger als 35 Tage betragen, w\u00e4hrend eine Amenorrhoe dagegen bedeutet, dass gar keine Blutungen auftreten. - Virilisierung als klinisches Zeichen zu hoher Androgenspiegel. Dieses Symptom erfordert die Suche nach anderen Erkrankungen der Hypophyse, der Nebenniere und des Ovars. Klinisch kann sich die Virilisierung als Hyperseborrhoe, Akne, Hirsutismus oder Alopezie manifestieren.

Das Calcium ist insbesondere f\u00fcr die Remineralisation der Z\u00e4hne zust\u00e4ndig, was auch an der bevorzugten Zahnsteinbildung an den Lingualfl\u00e4chen der Unterkieferfrontz\u00e4hne sichtbar wird. Zum anderen scheint der lange, gewundene und nach oben ansteigende Verlauf des Ausf\u00fchrungsganges (Ductus Wharton) bei der Entstehung eine Rolle zu spielen. Lippen und Wange sind die bevorzugte Lokalisation von den seltenen Speichelsteinen der kleinen Speicheldr\u00fcsen. Die Steine bestehen aus einer zentralen organischen Matrix aus Glykoproteinen, Mukopolysacchariden, Lipiden und Zelltr\u00fcmmern von Bakterien und den Gangw\u00e4nden mit konzentrischen anorganischen Anlagerungen, vorwiegend aus Calciumphosphat (z.

Es bestehen hierzu unterschiedliche Annahmen. Eine besagt, dass die Symptomatik der SAD-Patienten in Zusammenhang mit dem Serotonin-Melatonin-Stoffwechsel steht. Lichteinfall auf die Netzhaut wirkt als Zeitgeber, indem es dort vermehrt Melanopsin bilden l\u00e4sst. Das mittags vorherrschende kurzwellige (blau-betonte) Licht wirkt hierbei stark, das eher langwellige (rot-betonte) Licht der Abendd\u00e4mmerung wenig. Unter dem Einfluss des Melanopsins senden spezielle fotosensitive Ganglienzellen Signale in das Gehirn, das darauf die innere Uhr des Organismus auf Tagesaktivit\u00e4t einstellt. In der Zirbeldr\u00fcse (Epiphyse) des Gehirns des Menschen befinden sich viele Serotonin produzierende Zellen. Im Rahmen der Tagesaktivierung sch\u00fctten diese Zellen verst\u00e4rkt Serotonin aus. Es wirkt stimmungsaufhellend. Dagegen wird die Bildung von Melatonin aus Tryptophan und Serotonin durch auf die Netzhaut des Auges gelangende Lichtreize gehemmt, so dass die Melatoninkonzentration des Gehirns tags\u00fcber gering ist, nachts dagegen mit einem Maximum gegen drei Uhr morgens um ein Mehrfaches ansteigt. Es ist umstritten, ob Melatonin Depressionen ausl\u00f6st, anerkannt ist aber, dass es das Schlafbed\u00fcrfnis erh\u00f6ht. Diesem t\u00e4glichen (circadianen) Rhythmus \u00fcberlagert sich mit zunehmendem Abstand von den Tropen ein jahreszeitlicher (saisonaler): Im Winter f\u00fchren die in den h\u00f6heren Breiten gegen\u00fcber dem Sommer l\u00e4ngeren Dunkelphasen zu allgemein verringerten Serotonin- und erh\u00f6hten Melatonin-Werten. Daraus resultiert dann bei einigen Menschen die saisonale (winterliche) Depression. Die von der asaisonalen Depression abweichenden Symptome der Winterdepression (vermehrte Schlafneigung, erh\u00f6hter Appetit) lassen sich also mit einer tags\u00fcber verminderten Serotonin- und erh\u00f6hten Melatoninproduktion erkl\u00e4ren. Einige Wissenschaftler argumentieren, dass diese jahreszeitlichen Schwankungen urspr\u00fcnglich keinen Krankheitswert hatten, sondern im Gegenteil eine wichtige Bedeutung f\u00fcr das \u00dcberleben der Gruppe gehabt haben k\u00f6nnten. Die Tatsache, dass der Organismus als Reaktion auf die k\u00fcrzer werdenden Tage mit Schonung der eigenen Ressourcen (etwa durch vermehrten Schlaf) und Gewichtszunahme reagiert, war nach dieser Theorie ein \u00fcberlebenswichtiger Vorteil. Problematisch sei dieser Mechanismus erst in der modernen westlichen Gesellschaft geworden, in der Ressourcen zu allen Jahreszeiten im \u00dcberfluss zur Verf\u00fcgung stehen und Aktivit\u00e4t unabh\u00e4ngig von der Jahreszeit gefordert wird. Wie bei allen Erkrankungen sollte zun\u00e4chst eine kausale Therapie versucht werden. Durch Wiederherstellen der Zeitgeber f\u00fcr die Produktion von Serotonin und Melatonin kann der Winterdepression entgegengewirkt werden. Sinnvoll ist daher vor allem ausreichend Licht am fr\u00fchen Morgen."}

In Asien, Afrika und S\u00fcdamerika, wo die Erkrankung fr\u00fcher selten war, ist allerdings ein deutlicher Anstieg der Neuerkrankungen zu bemerken. Die Ursache der Erkrankung ist unbekannt. \u00c4hnlich wie beim Morbus Crohn nimmt man eine genetisch pr\u00e4disponierte, krankhaft gesteigerte Immunreaktion gegen die Darmflora an. Es konnten mehrere Genmutationen identifiziert werden, die mit dem Auftreten von chronisch-entz\u00fcndlichen Darmerkrankungen in Verbindung stehen. Wie bei Morbus Crohn steht der NF-\u03baB-Transkriptionsfaktor im Verdacht, durchg\u00e4ngig aktiv zu sein.

Erstes Symptom sind Ein- und Durchschlafst\u00f6rungen und dadurch bedingt Benommenheit und Schl\u00e4frigkeit am Tage. Sp\u00e4ter im Krankheitsverlauf treten oneiroide Zust\u00e4nde auf: Der Erkrankte f\u00e4llt, sich selbst \u00fcberlassen, in einen traumartigen Zustand mit Halluzinationen und einem Verhalten, das dem Trauminhalt entspricht.

Die Betroffenen leiden unter Aufmerksamkeitsst\u00f6rungen, Ged\u00e4chtnisst\u00f6rungen und weiteren kognitiven Symptomen. Zur Diagnostik werden unter anderem Polysomnographie und EEG eingesetzt. Patienten mit FFI erreichen nur noch \u00fcber k\u00fcrzere Zeit Schlafstadium 1 und REM-Schlaf, die tieferen Schlafstadien 2\u20134 treten nicht mehr auf (Agrypnia excitata).

Den Screeningberichten der Deutschen Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Neugeborenenscreening f\u00fcr die Jahre 2004 bis 2006 ist zu entnehmen, dass in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland die H\u00e4ufigkeit eines Biotinidasemangels in der Gr\u00f6\u00dfenordnung von 1:20. 000 bis 1:25. 000 liegt. Das Biotinidase-Gen befindet sich auf Chromosom 3 im Bereich p25. Es sind mehr als 60 Mutationen bekannt, die einen Enzymdefekt verursachen. Schwerer Biotinidasemangel mit unter 10 % Enzymaktivit\u00e4t entsteht, wenn beide Allele ein v\u00f6llig oder fast v\u00f6llig defektes Enzym codieren. Zu partiellem Biotinidasemangel mit 10\u201330 % Enzymaktivit\u00e4t kommt es, wenn die eine Genvariante einen schwerwiegenden Defekt, die andere dagegen nur einen Teildefekt mit betr\u00e4chtlicher Restaktivit\u00e4t produziert. Daneben finden sich in der Literatur aber auch andere Einteilungen. Das Enzym Biotinidase hat die Aufgabe Biocytin, ein Zwischenprodukt des Biotinstoffwechsels, zu spalten und so das darin enthaltene Biotin f\u00fcr den Organismus zur\u00fcckzugewinnen. Geschieht das ineffizient, geht Biocytin \u00fcber die Nieren verloren. Durch den \u00fcberdurchschnittlichen Verlust ersch\u00f6pfen sich die Biotinvorr\u00e4te des K\u00f6rpers trotz ansonsten ad\u00e4quater Ern\u00e4hrung nach und nach. Dadurch wird die Funktion der vier biotinabh\u00e4ngigen Carboxylasen beeintr\u00e4chtigt, die grundlegende Aufgaben im Kohlenhydrat-, Protein- und Lipidstoffwechsel erf\u00fcllen: - Pyruvat-Carboxylase (Bereitstellung von Oxalacetat f\u00fcr Citratzyklus und Gluconeogenese) - Propionyl-CoA-Carboxylase (notwendig f\u00fcr die Verstoffwechselung von Aminos\u00e4uren und Fetts\u00e4uren mit ungradzahligen oder verzweigten Ketten) - Methylcrotonoyl-CoA-Carboxylase (notwendig f\u00fcr die Verstoffwechselung der Aminos\u00e4ure Leucin) - Acetyl-CoA-Carboxylase (notwendig f\u00fcr die Lipogenese) Infolgedessen wird einerseits der Citratzyklus beeintr\u00e4chtigt und damit die Energieversorgung der Zellen, andererseits reichern sich in den Mitochondrien Stoffwechselzwischenprodukte in gesundheitssch\u00e4dlicher Konzentration an, die dann ins Zytosol und schlie\u00dflich in die K\u00f6rperfl\u00fcssigkeiten \u00fcbertreten. Sind die abnormen Abbauprodukte, oft unter dem Begriff organische S\u00e4uren zusammengefasst, im Urin nachweisbar, spricht man von Organoazidurie.

Antippen des Kinns oder eine Ber\u00fchrung der Haut die Symptomatik mildert. Die Ursache von Dystonien liegt in einer St\u00f6rung der Regulation der unbewussten Motorik im Bereich der Basalganglien im Gehirn. Besonders der Globus pallidus internus scheint eine Rolle zu spielen (vgl. Morbus Parkinson). In den meisten F\u00e4llen werden keine erblichen Zusammenh\u00e4nge festgestellt. Beim Hemispasmus facialis wird der Nervus facialis innerhalb des Sch\u00e4dels durch eine Arterienschlinge eingeengt. Diagnostisch sind kurzdauernde Dystonien oft leicht mit Tics zu verwechseln.

Gelegentlich ist auch eine Vergr\u00f6\u00dferung von Leber und Milz zu beobachten (Hepatosplenomegalie). Die Diagnose l\u00e4sst sich schnell und sicher \u2013 auch pr\u00e4natal \u2013 \u00fcber eine Messung der Ceramidase-Aktivit\u00e4t stellen. Eine wirksame, heilende Therapie ist derzeit nicht m\u00f6glich. Die Behandlung erfolgt meist symptomatisch mit Schmerzmitteln und Corticosteroiden. Bei starken Deformationen kann auch die Plastische Chirurgie zum Einsatz kommen. Das Farber-Syndrom wurde erstmals 1952 von dem US-amerikanischen Pathologen Sidney Farber (1903\u20131973) beschrieben. Er ist der Namensgeber f\u00fcr die Erkrankung."}

Daher sollte man zun\u00e4chst versuchen, die Kehle durch Heben des Kopfes zu dehnen. Diese Spannung f\u00fchrt manchmal dazu, dass sich die Tonsillensteine l\u00f6sen. Ein weiterer Weg, Tonsillensteine zu entfernen, besteht darin, mit einem Finger, Holzspatel oder Wattest\u00e4bchen gegen die Unterseite der Gaumenmandeln nach oben zu dr\u00fccken. Dieser leichte Druck l\u00f6st die Tonsillensteine oft heraus. Einige Personen sind in der Lage, dies mit ihrer Zunge zu machen. Dies ist eine gute Methode, da die Zunge nicht so stark den W\u00fcrgereflex ausl\u00f6st. Solange die Steine noch klein genug sind, kann eine medizinische Pipette, insbesondere eine mit gebogener Spitze, verwendet werden, um sie herauszusaugen. Eingelagerte Tonsillensteine, die innerhalb der Mandeln entstehen, sind jedoch nicht so leicht zu entfernen. Im Laufe der Zeit werden sie aber von selbst von den Gaumenmandeln freigegeben. Es ist auch manchmal m\u00f6glich kleinere Steine durch Schlucken bei geschlossenem Mund selbst herauszusaugen. Es ist ebenfalls m\u00f6glich, eine Munddusche zu verwenden, um die Mandelgr\u00fcfte zu reinigen und die weitere Entstehung von Tonsillensteinen zu verhindern. Dazu ist jedoch eine Munddusche mit einstellbarem Wasserdruck unter Verwendung einer geringen Druckstufe einzusetzen, um Gewebeverletzungen weitgehend auszuschlie\u00dfen. Hier ist eine Salzwasserl\u00f6sung zu empfehlen. Von einer Eigenbehandlung mit einem d\u00fcnnen Draht (beispielsweise Blumendraht), zu einer K\u00fcrette geformt, wird wegen einer nicht unerheblichen Verletzungsgefahr abgeraten; diese Form der Entfernung sollte dem HNO-Arzt \u00fcberlassen werden. Eine weitere Methode zur Entfernung der Tonsillensteine ist das Absaugen im Rahmen der Roederbehandlung. Die radikalste Art der Behandlung besteht entweder in der chirurgischen Entfernung der Tonsillensteine (meist bei starkem W\u00fcrgereiz und deutlichen Beschwerden) oder gar in einer vollst\u00e4ndigen chirurgischen Entfernung der Gaumenmandeln. Das alleinige Auftreten von Tonsillensteinen ist in der Regel jedoch keine Indikation zur Entfernung der Tonsillen."}

Die wesentlich gutartiger verlaufende juvenile progressive spinale Muskelatrophie wiederum wurde nach zwei Stockholmer Neurologen benannt, Eric Kugelberg und Lisa Welander. Sie haben 1956 die Erkrankung gegen\u00fcber Muskeldystrophien abgegrenzt. William R. Kennedy beschrieb die X-chromosomal rezessiv vererbte bulbospinale Muskelatrophie im Jahre 1968. Wie die anderen neuromuskul\u00e4ren Erkrankungen auch sind die spinalen Muskelatrophien relativ selten. Hinsichtlich der h\u00e4ufigsten Form, der infantilen Form, ist eine H\u00e4ufigkeit von 1 pro 25. 000 Geburten zu verzeichnen, bez\u00fcglich der juvenilen Form eine H\u00e4ufigkeit von 1 pro 75. 000 Geburten. Bei spinalen Muskelatrophien handelt es sich um Erkrankungen, die auf dem Untergang motorischer Nervenzellen (zweites motorisches Neuron, alpha-Motoneuron, Vorderhornzelle) im R\u00fcckenmark beruhen. Dadurch kommt es zum Schwund und zur Schw\u00e4che der Muskulatur. Beim Gesunden ziehen sich Muskelfasern durch die Aktivierung durch Nervenfasern (Innervation) zusammen. Dadurch wird der Muskel je nach der Zahl der beteiligten Muskelfasern k\u00fcrzer, er spannt sich an, eine Bewegung erfolgt. Muskelfasern, die von den erkrankten Nervenfasern nicht richtig angesprochen (innerviert) werden, ziehen sich nicht zusammen. So wie der gesamte Muskel schm\u00e4chtiger wird, wenn er nicht benutzt wird, z. B. wenn ein Arm nach einem Knochenbruch einige Wochen im Gips ruhiggestellt ist, werden die einzelnen Muskelfasern schm\u00e4chtig, wenn die sie aktivierenden Nervenfasern nicht funktionst\u00fcchtig sind. Da nicht der Muskel erkrankt, sondern ihn steuernde Nervenzellen, nennt man dies Muskelatrophie im Gegensatz zur Muskeldystrophie, wo der Muskel erkrankt. Durch die Krankheit nehmen Kraft und Ausdauer des Muskels ab."}

Knemidokoptes mutans ist ebenfalls Erreger der Kalkbeinr\u00e4ude bei H\u00fchnern, Puten, Perlh\u00fchnern und wild lebenden H\u00fchnerv\u00f6geln. Ein Erregerreservoir bilden latent infizierte V\u00f6gel in Zuchtanlagen sowie Wildv\u00f6gel. Die Ansteckung kann \u00fcber direkten Kontakt mit abgefallenen, milbenhaltigen Hornhautborken erfolgen oder durch den engen Kontakt infizierter Brutv\u00f6gel mit ihren Nestlingen bei der Schnabelf\u00fctterung (K. pilae). Der Erreger kann bei infizierten Tieren \u00fcber Monate oder Jahre ohne das Auftreten von Symptomen vorkommen. Durch Stressfaktoren wie zu gro\u00dfen Tierbesatz, Futtermangel oder Tumoren kommt es dann zur Entstehung der typischen schwammartigen Hornhautver\u00e4nderungen (Hyperkeratose) oder zu starken Schnabeldeformationen. K. pilae f\u00fchrt vor allem zu Ver\u00e4nderungen im Schnabelwinkel, K. mutans vor allem in den Zwischenzehenspalten. Es entstehen schwammartig por\u00f6se, kalkgrau, wei\u00df oder gelblich gef\u00e4rbte Hornhautwucherungen. Die Ver\u00e4nderungen durch K. mutans sind auf die Haut der Hintergliedma\u00dfen beschr\u00e4nkt.

Klinisch relevante Polymorphismen sind vor allem im Enzym MTHFR (Methylentetrahydrofolat-Reduktase) zu finden. Die h\u00e4ufigste vorkommende Mutation ist der Aminos\u00e4urenaustausch Alanin gegen Valin an der Position 677. Diese Form des Enzyms ist thermolabil und f\u00fchrt zu einer bis zu 50 % verminderten Leistung bei 37 \u00b0C (K\u00f6rpertemperatur). Aufgrund \u00e4u\u00dferer Faktoren kann es zu einer milden bis moderaten Erh\u00f6hung der Homocysteinkonzentration im Blut kommen. Zu bedenken ist, dass eine Erh\u00f6hung des Homocysteinwertes in vielen F\u00e4llen ein multifaktoriell ausgel\u00f6stes Ph\u00e4nomen ist. Erh\u00f6hte Homocysteinwerte findet man bei Alkoholkonsum, Rauchen, h\u00e4ufigem Genuss von Kaffee, Bewegungsarmut und \u00dcbergewicht. Auch bestimmte Medikamente k\u00f6nnen die Homocysteinkonzentration beeinflussen. H\u00e4ufig f\u00fchrt ein Mangel an Fols\u00e4ure und Cobalamin (der auch durch Entz\u00fcndungsprozesse hervorgerufen werden kann) zum Anstieg der Homocysteinwerte.

Bei einem Homocysteinspiegel von \u00fcber 15 \u00b5mol/l besteht einheitlich in mehreren Studien ein erh\u00f6htes Risiko. Obgleich Fols\u00e4ure und B-Vitamine den Homocysteinspiegel nachweislich senken, ist die Datenlage zur gef\u00e4\u00dfsch\u00fctzenden Wirkung uneinheitlich. Teilweise kann kein Effekt auf das Herzinfarktrisiko, wohl aber zur Senkung des Schlaganfallrisikos (bis zu 25 % Reduktion) dargestellt werden. Eine systematische \u00dcbersichtsarbeit der Cochrane Collaboration ergab, dass die Supplementierung von B-Vitaminen f\u00fcr die Pr\u00e4vention von Herz-Krankheiten keine Rolle spielt. Hingegen zeigte eine Metaanalyse aus dem gleichen Jahr, dass die Einnahme von Fols\u00e4ure bei Patienten mit bekannten Gef\u00e4\u00dfsch\u00e4den und hohem Gef\u00e4\u00dfrisiko, insbesondere bei eingeschr\u00e4nkter Nierenfunktion, das Fortschreiten der Arteriosklerose verhindern kann. Eine Studie mit Patienten, die an Multiple Sklerose erkrankt sind, hat ergeben, dass der Homocysteinspiegel mit dem Grad von Depression korreliert. Allerdings zeigte sich kein Zusammenhang mit deren Vitamin-B- und Fols\u00e4urewerten und dem Grad der Behinderung, was auf einen bisher unbekannten Faktor f\u00fcr den erh\u00f6hten Homocysteinspiegel schlie\u00dfen l\u00e4sst.
